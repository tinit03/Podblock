[47.42-47.56]  more
[47.56-47.88]  gently,
[48.30-48.30]  but
[48.30-48.52]  I
[48.52-48.74]  just
[48.74-49.08]  remember
[49.08-49.90]  Anita's

[50.92-51.20]  Everything

[54.66-55.10]  like
[55.10-55.28]  who
[55.28-55.46]  could
[55.46-55.64]  do
[55.64-56.04]  this.
[56.78-57.04]  Tyler
[57.04-57.68]  Schmaltz
[57.68-58.26]  was
[58.26-58.40]  kind
[58.40-58.50]  of
[58.50-59.10]  infatuated
[59.10-59.36]  with

[61.98-62.18]  of
[62.18-62.72]  frenzoned
[62.72-63.02]  him
[63.02-63.22]  pretty
[63.22-63.54]  quickly.
[63.92-64.24]  Yes.
[65.30-65.62]  Nicole
[65.62-66.16]  Rice's
[66.16-66.40]  name
[66.40-66.70]  came
[66.70-67.16]  up.
[67.36-67.56]  I
[67.56-68.08]  overheard
[68.08-68.78]  Nicole's
[68.78-69.30]  mom
[69.30-69.82]  asking,
[70.16-70.16]  how
[70.16-70.34]  could
[70.34-70.48]  you
[70.48-70.68]  think
[70.68-70.90]  my
[70.90-71.10]  daughter
[71.10-71.38]  did
[71.38-71.86]  this?
[73.86-74.38]  We
[74.38-74.62]  were
[74.62-75.14]  dispatched
[75.14-75.38]  to
[75.38-75.62]  a
[75.62-75.78]  call
[75.78-76.22]  of
[76.22-76.48]  someone
[76.48-76.90]  entering
[76.90-77.16]  an
[77.16-77.54]  apartment.
[78.22-78.26]  There
[78.26-78.52]  was
[78.52-78.94]  a
[78.94-79.28]  male.
[79.74-79.78]  He
[79.78-80.14]  had
[80.14-80.36]  a
[80.36-80.84]  knife.
[81.12-81.26]  There
[81.26-86.36]  were
[86.36-86.84]  many
[86.84-87.44]  possible
[87.44-88.08]  suspects.
[90.24-90.32]  If
[90.32-90.52]  someone
[90.52-90.76]  told
[90.76-91.00]  you
[91.00-91.22]  that
[91.22-91.80]  apartment,
[92.14-92.16]  you
[92.16-92.32]  said
[92.32-92.46]  you
[92.46-92.70]  killed
[92.70-92.92]  him.
[93.24-93.48]  You
[93.48-93.66]  didn't
[93.66-93.68]  even
[93.68-94.10]  lie.
[95.18-95.64]  We've
[95.64-95.78]  been
[95.78-96.10]  reliving
[96.10-96.70]  this,
[96.90-96.94]  every
[96.94-97.18]  single
[97.18-97.50]  day,
[97.62-97.78]  for
[97.78-98.06]  18
[98.06-98.58]  years.
[99.07-99.75]  It's
[99.75-100.25]  really
[100.25-100.69]  scary
[100.69-101.19]  not
[101.19-101.47]  knowing
[101.47-101.69]  how
[101.69-101.87]  that's
[101.87-102.03]  going
[102.03-102.07]  to
[102.07-102.23]  turn
[102.23-102.57]  out.
[102.89-102.89]  A
[102.89-103.19]  popular
[103.19-103.75]  college
[103.75-104.27]  student
[104.27-104.79]  murdered
[104.79-105.29]  a
[105.29-105.55]  case
[105.55-105.89]  that
[105.89-106.13]  dragged
[106.13-106.47]  on
[106.47-106.73]  for
[106.73-107.29]  years.
[107.81-107.87]  Good
[107.87-108.59]  revelations
[108.59-108.89]  during
[108.89-109.23]  a
[109.23-109.61]  party
[109.61-110.09]  finally
[110.09-110.61]  solved
[110.61-110.87]  the
[110.87-111.29]  mystery.

[126.53-127.09]  Minacht.
[135.56-136.08]  The
[136.08-136.48]  town
[136.48-136.96]  is
[136.96-137.48]  mostly
[137.48-137.98]  quiet
[137.98-139.08]  now.
[139.74-139.98]  Just
[139.98-140.12]  a

[160.82-161.22]  that
[161.22-161.90]  spanned
[161.90-162.36]  nearly
[162.36-162.86]  two
[162.86-163.46]  decades.
[164.03-164.49]  You

[216.08-216.24]  place
[216.24-216.44]  that
[216.44-216.74]  small?
[216.92-217.22]  Quiet?
[218.32-218.54]  Yeah.
[218.84-219.24]  Yeah.
[219.72-219.90]  I
[219.90-220.10]  think
[220.10-220.42]  that's
[220.42-220.60]  kind
[220.60-220.60]  of
[220.60-220.72]  all
[220.72-220.82]  I
[220.82-220.98]  can
[220.98-221.32]  say.
[221.62-221.80]  It's
[221.80-221.88]  so
[221.88-222.36]  quiet.
[222.62-222.92]  My
[222.92-223.06]  dad
[223.06-223.26]  was
[223.26-223.40]  a

[223.70-223.86]  12
[223.86-224.24]  years
[224.24-224.46]  and
[224.46-224.72]  my
[224.72-225.28]  friends
[225.28-225.48]  would
[225.48-225.70]  come
[225.70-225.96]  over
[225.96-226.24]  and
[226.24-226.44]  have
[226.44-227.02]  sleepovers
[227.02-227.28]  and
[227.28-227.38]  like
[227.38-227.60]  my
[227.60-227.80]  dad,
[227.90-227.96]  the
[227.96-228.12]  mayor
[228.12-228.32]  would
[228.32-228.52]  wake
[228.52-228.72]  us
[228.72-228.92]  up
[228.92-229.02]  to

[231.84-231.84]  Like
[231.84-232.76]  it
[232.76-233.14]  wasn't
[233.14-233.46]  that
[233.46-233.90]  fun.
[234.70-234.84]  That's
[234.84-234.90]  what
[234.90-234.98]  you
[234.98-235.14]  do
[235.14-235.28]  when
[235.28-235.36]  you're
[235.36-235.46]  the

[15.28-15.48]  the
[15.48-15.66]  weekends
[15.66-15.88]  she

[22.04-22.16]  went
[22.16-22.38]  to
[22.38-22.60]  college.
[22.82-22.92]  Yeah,

[26.20-26.40]  hard
[26.40-26.70]  worker,
[26.88-26.90]  but
[26.90-27.04]  she
[27.04-27.20]  still
[27.20-27.34]  made
[27.34-27.66]  time

[28.30-28.44]  for
[28.44-28.56]  her
[28.56-28.92]  family.
[29.15-29.49]  So
[29.49-29.73]  when
[29.73-30.23]  Anita's
[30.23-30.53]  family
[30.53-30.89]  didn't
[30.89-31.15]  hear

[37.19-37.43]  least,

[42.19-42.59]  then,
[43.13-43.51]  Sunday.
[44.33-44.45]  Was

[45.09-45.35]  out
[45.35-45.49]  of
[45.49-45.83]  character

[46.95-47.21]  hear
[47.21-47.51]  from
[47.51-47.69]  Anita?
[47.71-47.95]  Very
[47.95-48.25]  much
[48.25-48.59]  so,
[48.81-49.21]  absolutely.
[50.09-50.35]  By
[50.35-50.83]  Monday,
[51.11-51.33]  with
[51.33-51.65]  no
[51.65-51.93]  word

[52.27-52.61]  Anita,
[53.07-53.25]  her
[53.25-53.53]  dad
[53.53-53.91]  Gordon
[53.91-54.33]  made
[54.33-54.63]  the

[55.17-55.57]  drive

[56.35-56.67]  apartment
[56.67-57.17]  to
[57.17-57.41]  check
[57.41-57.73]  on
[57.73-58.03]  her.
[58.19-58.67]  When
[58.67-58.83]  he
[58.83-59.09]  peered
[59.09-59.39]  through
[59.39-59.81]  Anita's
[59.81-60.11]  window,
[60.51-60.57]  he
[60.57-60.75]  saw
[60.75-61.03]  her
[61.03-61.37]  lying
[61.37-61.85]  face
[61.85-62.37]  down
[62.37-62.69]  in
[62.69-62.89]  her
[62.89-63.37]  bed.
[63.87-64.01]  The
[64.01-64.35]  apartment
[64.35-64.83]  manager
[64.83-65.11]  let
[65.11-65.39]  him

[66.43-67.01]  immediately
[67.01-67.63]  called
[67.63-68.45]  911.
[93.47-94.09]  Right
[94.09-94.71]  away,
[94.97-95.47]  Anita's
[95.47-95.79]  dad
[95.79-96.13]  called
[96.13-96.49]  his
[96.49-96.95]  sister,
[97.29-97.47]  Karen.
[98.39-98.39]  He
[98.39-98.79]  said,
[99.19-99.39]  you've
[99.39-99.51]  got
[99.51-99.61]  to
[99.61-99.79]  come
[99.79-101.79]  here.
[102.03-102.65]  He
[102.65-105.13]  must
[105.13-105.27]  have
[105.27-105.47]  said
[105.47-105.89]  she's
[105.89-106.13]  dead.
[107.07-107.25]  When
[107.25-107.45]  she
[107.45-107.91]  arrived,
[108.09-108.33]  police
[108.33-108.73]  were
[108.73-109.23]  already
[109.23-109.57]  on
[109.57-109.69]  the
[109.69-110.19]  scene.
[110.55-110.75]  So
[110.75-110.89]  you
[110.89-111.11]  drive
[111.11-111.31]  up
[111.31-111.43]  to
[111.43-111.53]  the
[111.53-111.99]  apartment
[111.99-112.69]  and
[112.69-112.85]  the
[112.85-112.97]  only
[112.97-113.15]  thing
[113.15-113.35]  that
[113.35-113.39]  you
[113.39-113.81]  know
[113.81-114.49]  is
[114.49-114.65]  that

[114.97-115.27]  gone.
[115.71-115.93]  Anita's
[115.93-116.13]  gone.
[116.71-116.71]  Right.
[116.83-117.25]  I
[117.25-117.69]  can't
[117.69-118.23]  imagine
[118.23-118.89]  Karen,
[119.43-119.91]  him
[119.91-120.19]  coming
[120.19-120.53]  to

[122.61-122.85]  being
[122.85-123.15]  the
[123.15-123.31]  one
[123.31-123.61]  to
[123.61-123.99]  discover
[123.99-124.53]  that
[124.53-124.69]  she
[124.69-124.83]  had
[124.83-125.03]  been
[125.03-125.39]  killed.
[126.55-126.65]  When
[126.65-126.93]  you
[126.93-127.15]  got
[127.15-127.43]  there
[127.43-127.55]  and
[127.55-127.75]  saw
[127.75-128.37]  him,
[128.73-128.95]  how
[128.95-129.25]  was
[129.25-129.65]  he?
[129.95-130.33]  Oh,
[130.67-131.13]  in
[131.13-131.61]  shock.
[132.01-132.07]  I
[132.07-132.23]  mean,
[132.59-132.89]  it's
[132.89-133.09]  just
[133.09-133.83]  something
[133.83-134.05]  you
[134.05-134.37]  never
[134.37-134.87]  ever
[134.87-135.17]  can
[135.17-135.51]  prepare
[135.51-135.99]  yourself

[144.13-144.81]  he's...
[144.78-145.34]  waiting
[145.34-145.68]  for
[145.68-146.00]  more
[146.00-146.66]  information
[146.66-147.86]  from
[147.86-148.16]  the
[148.16-149.02]  detectives
[149.02-149.44]  and
[149.44-149.60]  yet
[149.60-149.80]  he
[149.80-150.04]  knows
[150.04-150.18]  he
[150.18-150.38]  needs
[150.38-150.58]  to
[150.58-150.58]  go

[155.32-155.34]  So
[155.34-155.84]  he
[155.84-156.04]  stayed
[156.04-156.34]  for
[156.34-156.56]  a

[156.96-157.48]  but
[157.48-157.70]  then
[157.70-157.82]  he

[161.62-161.68]  he
[161.68-161.96]  stayed.
[162.90-162.90]  I
[162.90-163.20]  wouldn't
[163.20-163.78]  leave.
[165.44-165.58]  What
[165.58-165.80]  made
[165.80-165.96]  you
[165.96-166.46]  stay?
[167.60-167.82]  Couldn't
[167.82-168.16]  leave.
[169.70-169.86]  We
[169.86-170.16]  had
[170.16-170.28]  to
[170.28-170.50]  stay
[170.50-170.74]  there
[170.74-170.90]  for
[170.90-171.30]  her.
[173.28-173.80]  You
[173.80-173.98]  felt
[173.98-174.20]  you
[174.20-174.32]  were
[174.32-174.62]  being
[174.62-174.86]  there
[174.86-175.02]  for
[175.02-176.38]  her.
[176.78-176.82]  Had
[176.82-176.98]  to
[176.98-177.12]  be
[177.12-177.78]  there.
[179.00-179.10]  She
[179.10-179.38]  knew
[179.38-179.62]  when
[179.62-179.92]  that
[179.92-180.48]  instant
[180.48-181.28]  everything
[181.28-181.80]  had
[181.80-182.48]  changed.
[182.84-183.04]  From
[183.04-183.26]  that
[183.26-183.52]  day
[183.52-183.90]  on,

[184.54-184.74]  be
[184.74-185.02]  dark,
[185.12-185.24]  the
[185.24-185.50]  doors
[185.50-185.82]  were
[185.82-186.22]  definitely
[186.22-186.64]  locked,
[186.80-186.84]  the
[186.84-187.06]  shades
[187.06-187.32]  were
[187.32-187.70]  pulled.
[188.20-188.36]  And
[188.36-188.58]  the
[188.58-189.00]  mystery
[189.00-189.28]  of
[189.28-189.50]  who
[189.50-189.78]  killed
[189.78-190.16]  Anita
[190.16-191.00]  was
[191.00-191.50]  only
[191.50-191.94]  just
[191.94-192.38]  beginning.
[192.94-193.26]  Somebody
[193.26-193.62]  is
[193.62-194.10]  there

[196.08-196.30]  to
[196.30-196.42]  her
[196.42-196.74]  neck.
[196.84-197.06]  It
[197.06-197.22]  was
[197.22-197.52]  scary,
[197.68-197.68]  I
[197.68-197.90]  mean,
[198.22-198.38]  because
[198.38-198.66]  anybody
[198.66-198.92]  in
[198.92-199.28]  everybody
[199.28-199.90]  is

[199.98-200.16]  suspect
[200.16-200.48]  to
[200.48-200.72]  me.
[200.80-201.06]  As

[201.62-201.70]  chance
[201.70-201.96]  that
[201.96-202.02]  he
[202.02-202.20]  crawled
[202.20-202.42]  into
[202.42-202.70]  the
[202.70-202.70]  window
[202.70-202.96]  and
[202.96-203.10]  killed
[203.10-203.40]  the
[203.40-203.76]  girl,
[204.10-204.12]  he
[204.12-204.36]  was
[204.36-204.62]  like,
[204.78-204.86]  I
[204.86-204.94]  can't
[204.94-205.18]  breath,
[205.46-205.66]  I
[205.66-205.86]  can't
[205.86-205.86]  breath,

[205.86-206.10]  smell
[206.10-206.26]  your

[207.56-207.80]  It
[207.80-207.86]  was
[207.86-208.18]  pressure
[208.18-208.48]  from
[208.48-208.62]  a
[208.62-208.84]  TV
[208.84-209.22]  show.
[209.48-209.56]  They

[209.72-209.90]  an
[209.90-210.28]  incredible
[210.28-210.68]  amount
[210.68-210.80]  of
[210.80-211.16]  pressure
[211.16-211.68]  to

[233.92-234.10]  lot
[234.10-234.32]  to
[234.32-234.54]  think
[234.54-234.96]  about

[235.22-235.34]  he
[235.34-235.52]  made

--- Chunk 2 ---
[0.00-0.84]  unexplained
[0.84-1.28]  death
[1.28-1.54]  of
[1.54-1.68]  a
[1.68-2.06]  promising
[2.06-2.50]  young
[2.50-2.82]  college
[2.82-3.30]  student
[3.30-3.92]  was
[3.92-4.44]  virtually
[4.44-5.18]  unheard

[6.36-7.40]  Dakota.
[8.16-8.18]  So
[8.18-8.34]  as
[8.34-8.50]  you're
[8.50-8.62]  on
[8.62-8.76]  your
[8.76-8.86]  way
[8.86-9.32]  there,
[9.50-9.62]  what
[9.62-9.74]  are
[9.74-9.88]  you
[9.88-10.18]  thinking?
[10.72-10.86]  I
[10.86-11.12]  was
[11.12-11.38]  new
[11.38-11.64]  to
[11.64-12.24]  investigations,
[12.60-12.84]  kind
[12.84-12.98]  of
[12.98-13.18]  wondered
[13.18-13.40]  what
[13.40-13.74]  direction
[13.74-14.12]  we'd
[14.12-14.24]  go
[14.24-14.46]  in
[14.46-14.86]  and
[14.86-14.94]  are
[14.94-15.02]  we
[15.02-15.20]  going
[15.20-15.30]  to
[15.30-15.48]  solve
[15.48-15.78]  this
[15.78-15.96]  right
[15.96-16.30]  away?
[16.50-16.52]  Is
[16.52-16.54]  it
[16.54-16.68]  going
[16.68-16.72]  to
[16.72-16.90]  be
[16.90-17.38]  difficult?
[18.52-18.68]  On
[18.68-18.90]  that
[18.90-19.24]  early
[19.24-19.54]  evening
[19.54-19.84]  in
[19.84-20.26]  June,
[20.62-20.72]  Sergeant
[20.72-21.20]  Goodman
[21.20-21.58]  knew
[21.58-21.92]  very
[21.92-22.32]  little
[22.32-22.60]  when
[22.60-22.76]  he
[22.76-23.06]  arrived
[23.06-23.26]  at
[23.26-23.74]  Anita's
[23.74-24.04]  apartment.
[29.59-30.07]  So
[30.07-30.21]  when
[30.21-30.41]  you
[30.41-30.71]  got
[30.71-31.11]  here
[31.11-31.31]  to
[31.31-31.51]  the
[31.51-31.67]  scene
[31.67-31.93]  that
[31.93-32.45]  day,
[32.51-32.63]  what
[32.63-32.73]  did
[32.73-32.89]  you
[32.89-33.29]  see?
[34.13-34.25]  I
[34.25-34.47]  believe
[34.47-34.73]  they
[34.73-35.13]  had
[35.13-35.29]  to
[35.29-35.37]  please
[35.37-35.67]  tape
[35.67-35.93]  up
[35.93-36.39]  already.
[37.25-37.37]  The
[37.37-37.59]  crime
[37.59-37.89]  scene
[37.89-38.11]  van

[38.29-38.55]  parked
[38.55-38.75]  on
[38.75-38.85]  the
[38.85-39.13]  grass
[39.13-39.37]  right
[39.37-39.57]  out
[39.57-39.75]  front
[39.75-39.91]  of
[39.91-40.09]  the
[40.09-40.41]  door
[40.41-41.41]  and
[41.41-42.07]  detectives
[42.07-42.27]  were
[42.27-42.61]  inside
[42.61-42.83]  the
[42.83-43.17]  apartment.
[43.37-43.61]  Is
[43.61-43.77]  that
[43.77-43.91]  the
[43.91-44.07]  front
[44.07-44.29]  door
[44.29-44.57]  right
[44.57-44.81]  there?
[44.85-45.25]  That's
[45.25-45.35]  the
[45.35-45.55]  front
[45.55-45.75]  and
[45.75-46.01]  only
[46.01-46.49]  door
[46.49-46.87]  going
[46.87-47.07]  into
[47.07-47.23]  a
[47.23-47.41]  apartment
[47.41-47.71]  number
[47.71-48.45]  five.
[48.83-48.85]  The
[48.85-49.23]  bedroom
[49.23-49.71]  window
[49.71-50.07]  caught
[50.07-50.39]  his
[50.39-50.87]  eye.
[51.05-51.21]  What
[51.21-51.27]  did
[51.27-51.39]  you
[51.39-51.63]  notice
[51.63-52.07]  about
[52.07-52.39]  her
[52.39-52.73]  window?
[53.33-53.49]  I
[53.49-53.73]  noticed
[53.73-53.97]  that
[53.97-54.11]  the
[54.11-54.35]  screen
[54.35-54.67]  was
[54.67-55.15]  gone.
[55.95-56.17]  An
[56.17-56.61]  important
[56.61-57.25]  detail.
[57.60-58.30]  That
[58.30-58.72]  remained
[58.72-59.02]  to
[59.02-59.24]  be
[59.24-59.94]  seen.
[60.68-60.88]  As
[60.88-61.16]  police
[61.16-61.60]  began
[61.60-62.14]  processing
[62.14-62.50]  the
[62.50-62.68]  crime
[62.68-63.32]  scene,
[63.92-64.28]  Anita's
[64.28-64.66]  father,
[65.00-65.22]  Gordon,
[65.68-65.84]  had
[65.84-66.10]  begun
[66.10-66.42]  the
[66.42-66.68]  grim
[66.68-67.08]  duty
[67.08-67.48]  of
[67.48-67.72]  telling
[67.72-68.08]  his
[68.08-68.60]  family.
[69.46-69.86]  Anita's
[69.86-70.18]  15
[70.18-70.46] -year
[70.46-70.62] -old
[70.62-71.00]  sister
[71.00-71.56]  Anna
[71.56-72.00]  got
[72.00-72.16]  the
[72.16-72.34]  news
[72.34-72.58]  from
[72.58-72.76]  her
[72.76-73.28]  brother.
[85.94-86.50]  Finally,
[86.72-87.00]  he
[87.00-87.24]  spoke
[87.24-87.50]  the
[87.50-88.28]  words.
[89.44-89.82]  Anita
[89.82-90.72]  was
[90.72-91.32]  dead.
[91.94-92.08]  This
[92.08-92.48]  is,
[92.48-92.60]  of
[92.60-92.74]  course,
[92.86-92.96]  my
[92.96-93.22]  first
[93.22-93.80]  time
[93.80-94.22]  with
[94.22-94.46]  any
[94.46-94.70]  type
[94.70-94.90]  of
[94.90-95.20]  grief
[95.20-95.40]  at
[95.40-95.60]  this
[95.60-96.04]  level.
[96.34-96.50]  But
[96.50-96.64]  I
[96.64-97.12]  learned
[97.12-97.60]  about
[97.60-98.00]  myself
[98.00-98.14]  in
[98.14-98.36]  that
[98.36-98.76]  moment,
[98.76-99.02]  like
[99.02-99.04]  I
[99.04-99.30]  don't
[99.30-99.52]  want
[99.52-99.86]  people
[99.86-100.44]  around.
[100.60-100.62]  I
[100.62-100.92]  don't
[100.92-101.28]  want
[101.28-101.90]  people
[101.90-102.22]  coming
[102.22-102.46]  in
[102.46-102.58]  to
[102.58-102.82]  ask
[102.82-103.42]  me
[103.42-103.60]  if
[103.60-103.82]  I'm
[103.82-104.04]  okay
[104.04-104.38]  every
[104.38-104.64]  five
[104.64-105.10]  seconds,
[105.26-105.54]  especially
[105.54-105.92]  people
[105.92-106.20]  that
[106.20-106.46]  don't
[106.46-106.66]  know
[106.66-107.16]  me.
[107.86-108.34]  Daniel
[108.34-108.80]  was
[108.80-109.26]  also
[109.26-109.62]  taking
[109.62-109.92]  it
[109.92-110.54]  hard.
[110.90-111.02]  I
[111.02-111.34]  understand
[111.34-111.64]  that
[111.64-111.88]  Daniel
[111.88-112.10]  and
[112.10-112.56]  Anita
[112.56-113.12]  have
[113.12-113.28]  a
[113.28-113.52]  very
[113.52-113.90]  special
[113.90-114.50]  relationship.
[114.74-114.90]  They
[114.90-115.12]  did.
[115.28-115.66]  Mm
[115.66-115.96] -hmm.
[116.16-116.24]  They
[116.24-116.32]  were
[116.32-116.62]  very
[116.62-117.08]  close.
[118.04-118.04]  Gordon
[118.04-118.30]  and
[118.30-118.46]  his
[118.46-118.72]  wife
[118.72-119.08]  Sharon
[119.08-119.66]  adopted
[119.66-120.00]  the
[120.00-120.16]  three
[120.16-120.52]  siblings
[120.52-121.02]  when
[121.02-121.12]  they
[121.12-121.34]  were
[121.34-121.70]  all
[121.70-122.08]  very
[122.08-122.70]  young.
[123.32-123.36]  They
[123.36-123.62]  spent
[123.62-123.88]  their
[123.88-124.14]  early
[124.14-124.62]  childhood
[124.62-125.20]  in
[125.20-125.62]  sunny
[125.62-125.94]  southern
[125.94-126.54]  California.
[127.06-127.34]  It
[127.34-127.54]  was
[127.54-127.68]  a
[127.68-127.78]  fun
[127.78-128.00]  little
[128.00-128.34]  childhood,
[128.64-129.08]  yeah.
[129.78-129.96]  Lauren
[129.96-130.32]  Leslie,
[130.46-130.58]  again
[130.58-131.06]  Anita,
[131.32-131.62]  became
[131.62-132.20]  forever
[132.20-132.94]  friends
[132.94-133.34]  in
[133.34-133.82]  kindergarten.
[134.18-134.78]  What
[134.78-136.28]  was
[136.28-136.38]  it
[136.38-136.56]  about
[136.56-136.82]  Anita
[136.82-137.16]  that
[137.16-137.46]  just
[137.46-137.78]  really
[137.78-138.02]  drew
[138.02-138.26]  you
[138.26-138.38]  to
[138.38-138.72]  her?
[139.20-139.38]  She
[139.38-139.50]  was
[139.50-140.38]  just
[140.38-140.80]  positive
[140.80-141.10]  and
[141.10-141.40]  happy
[141.40-141.80]  and
[141.80-142.48]  just...
[142.60-143.22]  The
[143.22-143.50]  best.
[143.70-143.70]  I
[143.70-143.76]  mean,
[143.90-144.00]  she
[144.00-144.30]  always
[144.30-144.60]  did
[144.60-144.78]  what
[144.78-145.06]  was
[145.06-145.50]  right.
[145.82-146.10]  She
[146.10-147.12]  never,
[147.54-147.94]  like,
[148.02-148.38]  wavered
[148.38-148.56]  in
[148.56-148.86]  that.
[149.44-149.78]  Then
[149.78-150.14]  when
[150.14-150.34]  Anita
[150.34-150.70]  was
[150.70-151.08]  almost
[151.08-151.72]  14,
[152.18-152.38]  Gordon
[152.38-152.84]  decided
[152.84-153.12]  to
[153.12-153.26]  move
[153.26-153.52]  the
[153.52-153.84]  family
[153.84-154.20]  up
[154.20-154.64]  north
[154.64-155.02]  to
[155.02-155.34]  his
[155.34-155.88]  hometown
[155.88-156.42]  of
[156.42-157.34]  Butte.
[157.64-157.70]  One
[157.70-158.32]  day,
[158.90-159.00]  your
[159.00-159.14]  dad
[159.14-159.38]  comes
[159.38-159.58]  in
[159.58-159.76]  and
[159.76-160.38]  says,
[160.66-160.96]  moving
[160.96-161.18]  to
[161.18-161.32]  North
[161.32-161.58]  Dakota.
[162.10-162.26]  Yeah,
[162.50-162.62]  something
[162.62-162.94]  California
[162.94-163.28]  is
[163.28-163.54]  such
[163.54-164.14]  it's
[164.14-164.44]  obviously
[164.44-164.90]  very
[164.90-165.34]  different
[165.34-166.10]  than
[166.10-166.30]  North
[166.30-166.68]  Central
[166.68-167.00]  North
[167.00-167.42]  Dakota
[167.42-167.70]  for
[167.70-168.12]  sure.
[168.36-168.56]  For
[168.56-168.90]  Anita,
[169.12-169.34]  I
[169.34-169.34]  think
[169.34-169.58]  it
[169.58-170.02]  was
[170.02-170.70]  really
[170.70-171.02]  hard.
[171.24-171.24]  I
[171.24-171.46]  mean,
[171.63-172.11]  friendship
[172.11-172.31]  was
[172.31-172.45]  so
[172.45-172.71]  important
[172.71-172.99]  to
[172.99-173.19]  her
[173.19-173.67]  and
[173.67-173.87]  leaving
[173.87-174.15]  all
[174.15-174.21]  of
[174.21-174.33]  her
[174.33-174.55]  friends
[174.55-175.07]  behind.
[175.65-175.65]  And
[175.65-175.67]  I
[175.67-175.85]  mean,
[175.93-175.95]  she
[175.95-176.19]  was
[176.19-176.33]  a
[176.33-176.69]  tough
[176.69-177.15]  age
[177.15-177.53]  too.
[177.63-177.67]  I
[177.67-177.79]  mean,
[177.89-177.91]  we
[177.91-178.05]  went
[178.05-178.29]  from
[178.29-178.79]  being,
[178.79-178.83]  you
[178.83-179.29]  know,
[179.49-179.49]  like
[179.49-180.23]  being
[180.23-180.43]  in
[180.43-180.49]  a
[180.49-180.77]  school
[180.77-181.37]  where
[181.37-181.83]  lots
[181.83-181.95]  of
[181.95-182.13]  kids
[182.13-182.41]  looked
[182.41-182.59]  like
[182.59-182.95]  us
[182.95-183.51]  to
[183.51-183.89]  being
[183.89-184.09]  in
[184.09-184.15]  a
[184.15-184.39]  school
[184.39-185.01]  where
[185.01-185.17]  we're
[185.17-185.33]  the
[185.33-185.53]  only
[185.53-186.11]  three
[186.11-186.35]  black
[186.35-186.43]  and
[186.43-186.65]  brown
[186.65-186.93]  kids
[186.93-187.41]  there
[187.41-187.85]  is
[187.85-188.43]  pretty
[188.43-189.85]  jarring
[189.85-190.09]  to
[190.09-190.27]  say
[190.27-190.41]  at
[190.41-190.71]  least.
[191.11-191.25]  How
[191.25-191.39]  did
[191.39-191.57]  she
[191.57-191.89]  overcome
[191.89-192.35]  that?
[192.57-192.63]  You
[192.63-192.87]  know,
[192.87-192.93]  I
[192.93-193.13]  think
[193.13-193.41]  for
[193.41-193.77]  Anita,
[194.19-194.39]  she
[194.39-196.09]  was
[196.09-196.43]  always
[196.43-196.81]  good
[196.81-197.03]  with
[197.03-197.47]  challenges.
[198.01-198.01]  Like,
[198.11-198.39]  there
[198.39-198.55]  was
[198.55-198.81]  really
[198.81-199.09]  nothing
[199.09-199.31]  that
[199.31-199.41]  she
[199.41-200.33]  couldn't
[200.33-200.79]  make
[200.79-201.03]  it
[201.03-201.33]  through.
[201.48-201.78]  What
[201.78-201.88]  was
[201.88-202.00]  your
[202.00-202.24]  first
[202.24-202.68]  impression
[202.68-203.10]  of
[203.10-203.36]  Anita?
[204.08-204.28]  Just
[204.28-204.70]  like
[204.70-205.04]  teeny,
[205.10-205.60]  tiny
[205.60-206.26]  little
[206.26-206.76]  ball
[206.76-206.98]  of
[206.98-207.28]  energy
[207.28-207.54]  and
[207.54-208.10]  sunshine.

[209.40-209.70]  met
[209.70-210.00]  Anita

[213.46-213.86]  age,
[214.10-214.16]  she
[214.16-214.42]  thought
[214.42-214.78]  Anita
[214.78-215.34]  was
[215.34-215.80]  perfectly
[215.80-216.20]  put

[217.38-217.88]  Matching

[10.66-10.86]  getting
[10.86-11.10]  kind

[46.26-46.94]  dorms,
[47.08-47.18]  Anita
[47.18-47.62]  and
[47.62-47.76]  one
[47.76-47.88]  of
[47.88-48.04]  her
[48.04-48.52]  roommates,
[48.94-49.00]  Nicole
[49.00-49.64]  Thomas,
[50.08-50.34]  decided
[50.34-50.56]  to
[50.56-50.88]  move
[50.88-51.24]  off
[51.24-51.84]  campus.
[52.46-52.64]  I
[52.64-52.86]  think
[52.86-53.08]  they
[53.08-53.38]  just
[53.38-53.88]  wanted
[53.88-54.74]  to
[54.74-54.96]  have
[54.96-55.18]  their
[55.18-55.36]  own
[55.36-55.68]  space
[55.68-56.10]  so
[56.10-56.28]  then
[56.28-56.46]  they
[56.46-56.62]  were
[56.62-57.00]  both.
[57.12-57.46]  like
[57.46-57.82]  Lesis
[57.82-57.98]  get
[57.98-58.10]  an
[58.10-58.40]  apartment
[58.40-58.76]  together
[58.76-59.06]  so
[59.06-59.22]  they
[59.22-60.62]  did.
[61.46-61.84]  Anita's
[61.84-62.18]  apartment
[62.18-62.72]  had
[62.72-63.04]  become
[63.04-63.32]  a
[63.32-63.54]  crime
[63.54-64.26]  scene.
[64.70-64.94]  Those
[64.94-65.24]  who
[65.24-65.46]  knew
[65.46-65.70]  and
[65.70-65.92]  loved
[65.92-66.18]  her
[66.18-66.48]  gathered
[66.48-67.28]  outside,
[67.76-68.04]  brimming
[68.04-68.34]  with
[68.34-68.72]  questions
[68.72-69.04]  for
[69.04-69.60]  police.
[70.82-70.90]  And
[70.90-71.24]  police
[71.24-71.50]  would
[71.50-71.68]  have
[71.68-72.08]  questions
[72.08-72.46]  for
[72.46-72.84]  some
[72.84-73.06]  of
[73.06-73.50]  them
[73.50-73.94]  about
[73.94-74.40]  Anita,
[74.84-75.06]  her
[75.06-75.64]  life,
[76.18-76.28]  and
[76.28-76.44]  the
[76.44-76.74]  people
[76.74-77.04]  who
[77.04-77.40]  surrounded
[77.40-78.06]  her.
[78.56-78.68]  She
[78.68-78.88]  got
[78.88-79.08]  any
[79.08-79.42]  dyes
[79.42-79.60]  or
[79.60-79.90]  anything
[79.90-80.14]  that
[80.14-80.60]  she's
[80.60-80.88]  interested
[80.88-81.16]  in
[81.16-81.26]  over
[81.26-81.56]  there
[81.56-81.94]  interested
[81.94-82.20]  in
[82.20-83.44]  her.
[83.72-83.92]  Alright,
[84.16-84.34]  she's
[84.34-84.64]  going
[84.64-84.96]  to
[84.96-85.16]  go
[85.16-85.54]  so.

[197.80-197.96]  out
[197.96-198.20]  of
[198.20-198.64]  place?
[199.48-199.80]  There,
[199.86-199.96]  in
[199.96-200.08]  a
[200.08-200.44]  bedroom,
[200.98-201.34]  clothed
[201.34-201.44]  in
[201.44-201.64]  a
[201.64-201.80]  pink
[201.80-202.42]  bathrobe,
[202.59-203.01]  He
[203.01-203.29]  saw
[203.29-203.83]  Anita's
[203.83-204.25]  body
[204.25-204.93]  still
[204.93-205.19]  on
[205.19-205.51]  the
[205.51-205.77]  bed.
[206.27-206.27]  I
[206.27-206.49]  could
[206.49-206.69]  see
[206.69-206.99]  that
[206.99-207.83]  she
[207.83-208.67]  was
[208.67-208.85]  kind
[208.85-208.95]  of
[208.95-209.33]  flopped
[209.33-209.83]  over
[209.83-210.09]  laying
[210.09-210.31]  on
[210.31-210.47]  her
[210.47-210.85]  stomach.
[211.23-211.29]  I
[211.29-211.55]  noticed
[211.55-211.85]  her
[211.85-212.39]  room
[212.39-212.85]  seemed
[212.85-213.05]  to
[213.05-213.17]  be
[213.17-213.35]  in
[213.35-213.71]  order.
[213.91-214.09]  So
[214.09-214.17]  it
[214.17-214.39]  didn't
[214.39-214.67]  seem
[214.67-214.89]  like
[214.89-215.07]  there
[215.07-215.17]  had
[215.17-215.31]  been
[215.31-215.45]  a
[215.45-215.71]  struggle.
[216.07-216.39]  No.
[216.91-217.01]  There
[217.01-217.21]  did
[217.21-217.53]  not
[217.53-217.75]  seem
[217.75-217.91]  to
[217.91-218.07]  be
[218.07-218.13]  a
[218.13-218.39]  struggle
[218.39-218.65]  at
[218.65-219.35]  all.
[219.67-219.85]  I
[219.85-220.11]  had
[220.11-220.31]  also
[220.31-220.51]  looked
[220.51-220.87]  around
[220.87-221.37]  her
[221.37-221.85]  bedroom
[221.85-222.13]  and
[222.13-222.31]  I
[222.31-222.55]  noticed
[222.55-222.77]  that
[222.77-222.95]  her
[222.95-223.21]  purse
[223.21-223.51]  was
[223.51-224.03]  there.
[224.39-224.41]  I
[224.41-224.65]  could
[224.65-224.89]  see
[224.89-225.13]  that
[225.13-225.27]  there
[225.27-225.45]  was
[225.45-225.75]  cash
[225.75-225.97]  in
[225.97-226.17]  her
[226.17-226.65]  purse.
[226.83-227.15]  So
[227.15-227.19]  I
[227.19-227.43]  didn't

[172.48-172.68]  doors
[172.68-172.88]  are
[172.88-173.10]  locked
[173.10-173.28]  or
[173.28-173.76]  not.
[174.57-174.85]  from
[174.85-175.15]  that
[175.15-175.35]  day
[175.35-175.61]  on,
[175.69-175.75]  the
[175.75-175.97]  doors
[175.97-176.31]  were
[176.31-176.75]  definitely
[176.75-177.21]  locked
[177.21-177.61]  when
[177.61-177.77]  it
[177.77-177.85]  got
[177.85-177.97]  to
[177.97-178.15]  be
[178.15-178.43]  dark.
[178.73-178.91]  The

[179.15-179.43]  were
[179.43-179.73]  pulled.
[180.19-180.19]  I
[180.19-180.39]  felt
[180.39-180.95]  like
[180.95-181.35]  for
[181.35-181.41]  a
[181.41-181.63]  long
[181.63-182.11]  time,
[182.19-182.35]  and
[182.35-182.41]  I
[182.41-182.59]  still
[182.59-182.83]  am.
[182.93-183.15]  I'm

[185.45-185.69]  I'm
[185.69-185.99]  at,
[186.09-186.27]  who's
[186.27-186.71]  around.
[187.01-187.29]  People
[187.29-187.57]  were
[187.57-188.01]  worried.
[188.39-188.39]  I
[188.39-188.57]  mean,
[188.89-188.89]  that
[188.89-189.15]  it
[189.15-189.35]  just
[189.35-189.55]  got

[189.79-189.89]  it
[189.89-190.33]  was.
[191.99-192.39]  Meanwhile,
[192.93-193.25]  investigators
[193.25-193.83]  began
[193.83-194.25]  piecing
[194.25-194.65]  together
[194.65-194.89]  a
[194.89-195.27]  picture
[195.27-195.63]  of

[196.69-197.15]  Anita's
[197.15-197.39]  final

[168.42-168.62]  Two
[168.62-168.96]  days
[168.96-169.28]  after
[169.28-169.80]  Anita's
[169.80-170.12]  murder,
[170.50-170.58]  the
[170.58-170.92]  medical

[171.76-172.12]  released
[172.12-172.42]  the

[172.90-173.52]  report.
[174.16-174.24]  Was

[174.38-174.56]  any
[174.56-174.80]  sexual
[174.80-175.28]  assault?
[175.60-175.70]  There
[175.70-175.90]  was
[175.90-176.26]  nothing
[176.26-176.60]  that
[176.60-176.74]  we
[176.74-177.10]  could
[177.10-177.42]  see
[177.42-177.68]  that
[177.68-177.84]  would
[177.84-178.26]  indicate
[178.26-178.78]  that
[178.78-178.94]  she
[178.94-179.14]  was
[179.14-179.54]  sexually
[179.54-180.00]  assaulted.
[180.38-180.38]  It
[180.38-180.58]  was
[180.58-181.06]  definitely
[181.06-181.90]  something
[181.90-182.24]  that
[182.24-182.42]  we
[182.42-183.10]  were
[183.10-183.46]  concerned
[183.46-183.94]  about
[183.94-184.14]  and
[184.14-184.24]  it
[184.24-184.40]  was
[184.40-184.52]  on
[184.52-184.66]  our
[184.66-185.16]  minds.
[185.34-185.80]  But
[185.80-186.00]  the
[186.00-186.72]  autopsy
[186.72-187.12]  did
[187.12-187.54]  reveal
[187.54-188.14]  something
[188.14-188.70]  that
[188.70-188.96]  peaked
[188.96-189.26]  their
[189.26-189.76]  interest.
[190.34-190.40]  We
[190.40-191.02]  found
[191.02-191.32]  out
[191.32-191.44]  that
[191.44-191.52]  there
[191.52-191.82]  was
[191.82-192.46]  superficial
[192.46-193.52]  cuts
[193.52-193.94]  or
[193.94-194.36]  marks
[194.36-194.98]  on
[194.98-195.48]  Anita's
[195.48-195.86]  neck.
[197.08-197.08]  So
[197.08-197.68]  it
[197.68-197.82]  led
[197.82-198.08]  us
[198.08-198.20]  to
[198.20-198.50]  believe
[198.50-198.78]  that
[198.78-199.06]  somebody
[199.06-199.42]  is
[199.42-199.90]  there
[199.90-200.06]  kind
[200.06-200.14]  of
[200.14-200.30]  in
[200.30-200.54]  her
[200.54-201.20]  face
[201.20-201.68]  holding
[201.68-202.00]  the
[202.00-202.22]  knife
[202.22-202.44]  to
[202.44-202.56]  her
[202.56-203.06]  neck
[203.06-203.84]  and
[203.84-204.84]  then
[204.84-205.38]  an
[205.38-205.70]  angry
[205.70-206.26]  and
[206.26-206.50]  then
[206.50-206.68]  that
[206.68-207.04]  just
[207.04-207.54]  escalated
[207.54-207.78]  to
[207.78-207.82]  the
[207.82-208.12]  point
[208.12-209.10]  of
[209.10-209.50]  stabbing
[209.50-210.08]  her.
[210.92-211.08]  When
[211.08-211.16]  you
[211.16-211.30]  think
[211.30-211.50]  about
[211.50-211.78]  those
[211.78-212.28]  details,
[212.44-212.60]  does
[212.60-212.78]  that
[212.78-213.10]  sound
[213.10-213.62]  like?
[214.03-214.87]  Possibly
[214.87-215.21]  someone
[215.21-215.45]  she
[215.45-216.09]  knew,
[216.31-216.55]  complete
[216.55-217.17]  stranger.
[218.05-218.05]  We
[218.05-218.33]  felt
[218.33-218.57]  like
[218.57-218.69]  it
[218.69-218.79]  was
[218.79-219.09]  somebody
[219.09-219.41]  that
[219.41-219.57]  she
[219.57-220.39]  knew.
[220.79-220.85]  And
[220.85-221.07]  as
[221.07-221.23]  my
[221.23-221.45]  not
[221.45-221.95]  police
[221.95-222.69]  continued
[222.69-223.13]  talking
[223.13-223.37]  to
[223.37-223.63]  those
[223.63-224.01]  close
[224.01-224.25]  to
[224.25-224.51]  Anita,
[225.23-225.29]  they
[225.29-225.61]  got
[225.61-226.03]  a
[226.03-226.39]  promising
[226.39-227.11]  tip.
[227.57-227.57]  We
[227.57-227.85]  did
[227.85-228.11]  have
[228.11-228.39]  one
[228.39-228.93]  witness
[228.93-229.55]  come
[229.55-229.93]  forward
[229.93-230.27]  and
[230.27-230.45]  say
[230.45-230.81]  that
[230.81-231.27]  she
[231.27-231.59]  saw
[231.59-231.99]  somebody
[231.99-232.59]  running
[232.59-233.03]  early
[233.03-233.35]  that
[233.35-233.83]  morning.
[234.27-234.51]  It
[234.51-234.77]  was
[234.77-235.03]  a
[235.03-235.45]  man
[235.45-236.09]  running
[236.09-236.65]  near
[236.65-237.19]  Anita's
[237.19-237.57]  apartment.
[238.27-238.53]  He
[238.53-238.85]  appeared
[238.85-239.09]  to
[239.09-239.25]  be
[239.25-239.37]  in
[239.37-239.61]  his
[239.61-239.89]  late

--- Chunk 7 ---
[7.02-7.50]  It
[7.50-7.96]  was
[7.96-13.18]  their
[13.18-13.60]  first
[13.60-13.92]  big
[13.92-14.44]  lead.
[15.14-15.16]  Now
[15.16-15.40]  they
[15.40-15.74]  needed
[15.74-16.12]  to
[16.12-16.42]  find
[16.42-16.68]  the
[16.68-16.90]  running
[16.90-17.50]  man.
[17.74-17.94]  Maybe
[17.94-18.08]  it's
[18.08-18.28]  running
[18.28-18.56]  away
[18.56-18.78]  from
[18.78-18.88]  a
[18.88-19.02]  crime
[19.02-19.22]  scene.
[19.30-19.64]  That's
[19.64-19.76]  what
[19.76-20.00]  she
[20.00-20.22]  thought
[20.22-20.44]  it
[20.44-20.64]  could
[20.64-20.96]  be.
[34.41-34.93]  About
[34.93-35.21]  two
[35.21-35.59]  days
[35.59-35.91]  after
[35.91-36.27]  Anita
[36.27-36.95]  Knutzen's
[36.95-37.29]  murder,
[37.87-38.05]  police
[38.05-38.43]  were
[38.43-38.87]  chasing
[38.87-39.33]  a
[39.33-39.51]  new
[39.51-40.17]  tip.
[40.87-40.89]  A
[40.89-41.13]  woman
[41.13-41.37]  said
[41.37-41.53]  she
[41.53-41.73]  saw
[41.73-42.01]  a
[42.01-42.41]  young,
[42.53-42.77]  dark
[42.77-43.03] -haired
[43.03-43.47]  man
[43.47-43.97]  running
[43.97-44.39]  right
[44.39-44.57]  near
[44.57-45.07]  Anita's
[45.07-45.35]  apartment
[45.35-46.21]  around
[46.21-46.43]  the
[46.43-46.61]  time
[46.61-46.81]  of
[46.81-46.91]  the
[46.91-47.33]  murder.
[48.45-48.63]  And
[48.63-48.85]  he
[48.85-49.15]  looked
[49.15-49.59]  like
[49.59-49.71]  he
[49.71-49.95]  was
[49.95-50.13]  in
[50.13-50.27]  a
[50.27-50.57]  big
[50.57-51.07]  hurry.
[52.35-52.35]  So
[52.35-52.79]  she's
[52.79-52.79]  thinking
[52.79-53.13]  maybe
[53.13-53.35]  it's
[53.35-54.09]  not
[54.09-54.73]  running
[54.73-54.93]  out
[54.93-55.01]  for
[55.01-55.45]  exercise,
[55.65-55.81]  maybe
[55.81-55.95]  it's
[55.95-56.13]  running
[56.13-56.41]  away
[56.41-56.63]  from
[56.63-56.75]  a
[56.75-56.89]  crime
[56.89-57.09]  scene.
[57.35-57.75]  That's
[57.75-57.93]  what
[57.93-58.17]  she
[58.17-58.39]  thought
[58.39-58.59]  it
[58.59-58.81]  could
[58.81-59.49]  be.
[63.84-64.30]  and
[64.30-64.58]  it
[64.58-64.76]  did
[64.76-65.10]  generate
[65.10-65.50]  some
[65.50-66.00]  tips,
[66.64-66.64]  but
[66.64-66.96]  none
[66.96-67.10]  of
[67.10-67.36]  them
[67.36-67.70]  went
[67.70-68.50]  anywhere.
[71.02-71.18]  Back
[71.18-71.28]  in
[71.28-71.86]  Anita's
[71.86-72.20]  hometown
[72.20-72.56]  of
[72.56-72.80]  Bute,
[73.14-73.32]  her
[73.32-73.86]  presence
[73.86-74.54]  was
[74.54-75.38]  everywhere.
[76.88-77.02]  And
[77.02-77.18]  on
[77.18-77.52]  one
[77.52-77.96]  particular
[77.96-78.52]  day,
[78.76-78.92]  her
[78.92-79.30]  friends
[79.30-79.66]  honored
[79.66-80.04]  her
[80.04-80.36]  with
[80.36-80.66]  a
[80.66-80.98]  brilliant
[80.98-81.36]  burst
[81.36-81.66]  of
[81.66-82.12]  light
[82.12-82.82]  in
[82.82-83.18]  true
[83.18-83.80]  Anita's
[83.80-84.34]  style.
[84.96-85.12]  There
[85.12-85.32]  was
[85.32-85.50]  an
[85.50-85.86]  outpouring
[85.86-86.10]  of
[86.10-86.50]  love.
[86.64-87.08]  In
[87.08-87.48]  Bute.
[87.62-87.82]  Yeah.
[88.18-88.20]  After
[88.20-88.48]  Anita
[88.48-88.86]  died.
[89.12-89.28]  Yeah.
[89.66-90.24]  leading
[90.24-90.48]  up
[90.48-90.64]  to
[90.64-90.70]  the
[90.70-91.06]  funeral.
[91.50-91.62]  A
[91.62-91.76]  lot
[91.76-91.80]  of
[91.80-92.04]  us
[92.04-92.26]  girls

[92.74-93.10]  together
[93.10-93.42]  and
[93.42-93.76]  we
[93.76-94.72]  made

[96.78-97.48]  pins

[101.46-101.68]  pink
[101.68-102.38]  ribbons.
[102.62-102.64]  I
[102.64-102.78]  mean
[102.78-103.08]  that
[103.08-103.24]  it's
[103.24-103.40]  such
[103.40-103.54]  a
[103.54-103.74]  close
[103.74-103.90] -knit
[103.90-104.30]  community.
[104.66-104.70]  It's
[104.70-104.96]  really
[104.96-105.52]  amazing.
[107.24-107.52]  All

[108.08-108.40]  there's

[109.12-109.70]  ribbons
[109.70-109.92]  tied
[109.92-110.68]  up.
[110.68-110.82]  You
[110.82-110.96]  could
[110.96-111.20]  drive
[111.20-111.48]  by
[111.48-111.54]  and
[111.54-111.66]  it
[111.66-111.92]  wouldn't
[111.92-112.34]  be
[112.34-112.60]  weird
[112.60-112.86]  to
[112.86-113.18]  see
[113.18-113.32]  like

[115.36-115.56]  of
[115.56-115.90]  thing.
[116.41-116.97]  When
[116.97-117.47]  Anita's

[120.15-120.41]  was
[120.41-120.71]  blown
[120.71-121.41]  away.
[123.03-123.05]  I
[123.05-123.27]  remember
[123.27-123.63]  the
[123.63-123.93]  entire
[123.93-124.43]  town
[124.43-126.25]  was

[133.09-133.37]  bow
[133.37-133.75]  on
[133.75-134.33]  it.
[134.53-134.67]  We
[134.67-134.85]  will
[134.85-135.05]  miss
[135.05-135.19]  you
[135.19-135.53]  Anita,

[140.79-140.87]  Were

[143.61-144.11]  just
[144.11-144.37]  painted
[144.37-144.67]  pink
[144.67-144.87]  for
[144.87-145.13]  her?
[145.17-145.53]  Yeah.
[145.76-146.04]  I

[147.90-148.22]  doesn't
[148.22-148.54]  know

[159.22-159.74]  other.
[160.02-160.18]  And

[161.72-161.92]  the
[161.92-162.42]  entire
[162.42-163.14]  community
[163.14-163.72]  gathered
[163.72-164.04]  to
[164.04-164.20]  say
[164.20-164.84]  goodbye.
[165.28-165.30]  What
[165.30-165.54]  stands
[165.54-165.82]  out
[165.82-165.92]  to
[165.92-166.00]  you
[166.00-166.22]  the
[166.22-166.66]  most
[166.66-167.18]  about
[167.18-167.40]  her
[167.40-167.72]  funeral?
[167.95-168.21]  I
[168.21-168.33]  think
[168.33-168.55]  just
[168.55-168.61]  how
[168.61-168.81]  many
[168.81-169.17]  people
[169.17-169.43]  were
[169.43-169.77]  there
[169.77-170.03]  to
[170.03-170.39]  celebrate
[170.39-170.87]  my
[170.87-171.39]  sister.
[171.73-171.73]  I
[171.73-172.31]  mean,
[172.51-172.57]  she
[172.57-173.13]  truly
[173.13-173.43]  was
[173.43-173.79]  so
[173.79-174.23]  well
[174.23-174.59] -loved.
[174.79-174.81]  I
[174.81-175.09]  mean,
[175.15-175.33]  the
[175.33-175.55]  whole
[175.55-175.79]  church
[175.79-176.11]  was
[176.11-176.35]  full.
[176.47-176.53]  They
[176.53-176.67]  ended
[176.67-176.83]  up
[176.83-177.01]  having
[177.01-177.45]  to
[177.45-177.77]  open
[177.77-177.95]  up
[177.95-178.15]  the
[178.15-178.29]  gym
[178.29-178.53]  at
[178.53-178.69]  the
[178.69-179.07]  school
[179.07-179.33]  for
[179.33-179.47]  all
[179.47-179.55]  of
[179.55-179.73]  the
[179.73-180.01]  overflow
[180.01-180.83]  people.
[181.15-181.33]  And
[181.33-181.51]  they
[181.51-181.75]  watched
[181.75-182.15]  it,
[182.29-182.33]  like,
[182.37-182.61]  on
[182.61-182.89]  a
[182.89-183.19]  stream.
[183.63-183.77]  Did
[183.77-183.91]  you
[183.91-184.13]  speak
[184.13-184.37]  that
[184.37-184.53]  day?
[184.77-184.97]  I
[184.97-185.25]  did,
[185.33-185.61]  yeah.
[186.05-186.05]  I
[186.05-186.47]  got
[186.47-186.65]  up
[186.65-186.87]  there
[186.87-187.01]  and
[187.01-187.29]  just
[187.29-187.49]  said
[187.49-187.63]  a
[187.63-187.81]  few
[187.81-188.19]  words
[188.19-188.49]  about
[188.49-188.65]  my
[188.65-189.03]  sister
[189.03-189.27]  and
[189.27-189.55]  just
[189.55-189.77]  talked
[189.77-190.03]  about
[190.03-190.61]  how
[190.61-191.43]  just
[191.43-191.93]  effervescent
[191.93-192.13]  she
[192.13-192.57]  was
[192.57-192.81]  and
[192.81-193.21]  beautiful
[193.21-193.75]  and
[193.75-194.05]  perfect
[194.05-194.39]  really.
[194.73-195.07]  I
[195.07-195.23]  think
[195.23-195.45]  I
[195.45-195.49]  wore
[195.49-195.71]  one
[195.71-195.81]  of
[195.81-196.15]  Anita's

[200.21-200.53]  close
[200.53-200.71]  to

[204.43-204.73]  the
[204.73-204.97]  grief,
[205.43-205.57]  there
[205.57-205.85]  were
[205.85-206.87]  suspicions,
[207.43-207.77]  rumors
[207.77-208.49]  about
[208.49-208.99]  who
[208.99-209.25]  could
[209.25-209.47]  be
[209.47-209.87]  involved
[209.87-210.11]  in
[210.11-210.57]  Anita's

[213.11-213.17]  did
[213.17-213.35]  you

[217.41-217.57]  Yeah,
[217.57-217.59]  I
[217.59-217.81]  mean
[217.81-218.09]  tons
[218.09-218.29]  of
[218.29-218.63]  whispers
[218.63-219.01]  all

[221.21-221.45]  know,

[2.14-2.36]  the

[3.68-4.10]  drama.
[4.50-4.62]  They

[5.72-5.72]  yes.
[6.38-6.46]  Police
[6.46-6.72]  were
[6.72-7.12]  there
[7.12-7.44]  at
[7.44-7.60]  the

[11.46-11.60]  At

[15.08-15.36]  later
[15.36-15.64]  that
[15.64-16.20]  day.
[16.80-16.82]  A
[16.82-17.12]  move
[17.12-17.44]  that
[17.44-17.68]  may
[17.68-17.88]  not

[18.64-18.84]  with

[20.04-20.44]  Anita's
[20.44-20.74]  friends
[20.74-21.24]  remember
[21.24-21.68]  a
[21.68-22.02]  painful
[22.02-22.82]  exchange
[22.82-23.24]  between
[23.24-23.94]  Anita's
[23.94-24.36]  mom
[24.36-24.72]  and
[24.72-25.88]  Nicole's.
[26.72-26.86]  And
[26.86-27.02]  I
[27.02-27.58]  overheard
[27.58-28.62]  Nicole's
[28.62-28.98]  mom
[30.02-30.50]  asking
[30.50-30.96]  her
[30.96-31.26]  rather
[31.26-31.84]  aggressively
[31.84-33.50]  like
[33.50-33.64]  how
[33.64-33.84]  could
[33.84-33.98]  you
[33.98-34.18]  think
[34.18-34.34]  my
[34.34-34.58]  daughter
[34.58-34.90]  did
[34.90-35.74]  this?
[36.62-36.90]  I
[36.90-37.18]  can't
[37.18-37.60]  believe
[37.60-37.90]  that
[37.90-38.10]  this
[38.10-38.26]  is
[38.26-38.32]  the
[38.32-38.44]  room
[38.44-38.58]  we're
[38.58-38.76]  going
[38.76-39.10]  around
[39.10-39.34]  and
[39.34-39.80]  paraphrasing,
[39.96-40.02]  of
[40.02-40.18]  course,
[40.40-40.40]  because
[40.40-40.46]  I
[40.46-40.66]  can't
[40.66-40.86]  remember
[40.86-41.10]  the
[41.10-41.36]  exact
[41.36-41.62]  words,
[42.32-42.40]  but
[42.40-42.72]  something
[42.72-43.02]  to
[43.02-43.16]  the
[43.16-43.50]  effect
[43.50-43.98]  of,
[44.16-44.40]  you
[44.40-44.58]  know,
[44.58-44.66]  I
[44.66-44.94]  can't
[44.94-45.20]  believe
[45.20-45.44]  that
[45.44-45.66]  people
[45.66-45.82]  are
[45.82-46.06]  blaming
[46.06-46.42]  my
[46.42-46.70]  daughter
[46.70-46.96]  for
[46.96-47.34]  this.
[47.44-47.66]  This
[47.66-47.82]  is
[47.82-47.98]  all
[47.98-48.34]  happening
[48.34-48.78]  at
[48.78-48.88]  the
[48.88-49.16]  funeral.
[49.92-50.12]  Yes,
[50.28-50.38]  before
[50.38-50.62]  the
[50.62-50.88]  actual
[50.88-51.22]  funeral
[51.22-51.62]  started,
[52.26-52.26]  yep.
[52.84-52.98]  I
[52.98-53.24]  like
[53.24-53.40]  turned
[53.40-53.98]  around
[53.98-54.44]  and
[54.44-54.66]  like,
[55.06-55.24]  it
[55.24-55.44]  was
[55.44-55.76]  just
[55.76-56.10]  wild.
[56.36-56.66]  It
[56.66-57.16]  was
[57.16-57.26]  just,
[57.26-57.74]  it
[57.74-57.90]  was
[57.90-58.16]  just
[58.16-58.34]  wild
[58.34-58.70]  behavior
[58.70-58.94]  for
[58.94-59.04]  an
[59.04-59.36]  adult.
[60.36-60.46]  But
[60.46-60.66]  the
[60.66-60.96]  dust
[60.96-61.36]  settled
[61.36-61.88]  and
[61.88-62.00]  the
[62.00-62.38]  memorial
[62.38-62.88]  moved
[62.88-63.88]  on.
[64.54-64.76]  And
[64.76-64.90]  a
[64.90-65.14]  very
[65.14-65.50]  close
[65.50-65.98]  friend
[65.98-66.26]  took
[66.26-66.88]  over
[66.88-67.38]  Tyler
[67.38-68.10]  Schmolz,
[68.60-68.70]  the
[68.70-68.90]  young
[68.90-69.20]  man
[69.20-69.46]  on
[69.46-69.62]  the
[69.62-69.82]  scene
[69.82-70.14]  that
[70.14-70.36]  first
[70.36-70.90]  night.
[71.66-71.78]  He
[71.78-72.04]  was
[72.04-72.32]  now
[72.32-72.64]  in
[72.64-72.80]  the
[72.80-73.16]  middle
[73.16-73.42]  of
[73.42-73.88]  Anita's
[73.88-74.48]  goodbye.
[75.52-75.60]  We
[75.60-75.74]  met
[75.74-75.86]  a
[75.86-76.14]  slideshow
[76.14-76.30]  for
[76.30-76.36]  her
[76.36-76.80]  parents.
[77.12-77.24]  What
[77.24-77.40]  kind
[77.40-77.46]  of
[77.46-77.68]  pictures
[77.68-77.92]  did
[77.92-78.00]  you
[78.00-78.18]  want
[78.18-78.32]  to
[78.32-78.48]  pick
[78.48-78.70]  of
[78.70-78.92]  Anita?
[79.08-79.26]  The
[79.26-79.44]  problem
[79.44-79.66]  was
[79.66-79.82]  where
[79.82-80.04]  she's
[80.04-80.30]  dancing,
[80.56-80.68]  where
[80.68-80.96]  she's
[80.96-81.04]  with
[81.04-81.30]  friends
[81.30-81.50]  and
[81.50-81.98]  family.
[82.62-82.74]  Just
[82.74-82.90]  her
[82.90-83.08]  living
[83.08-83.28]  in
[83.28-83.30]  her
[83.30-83.64]  life.
[84.75-85.41]  He
[85.41-85.71]  also
[85.71-85.91]  took
[85.91-86.05]  it
[86.05-86.29]  upon
[86.29-86.83]  himself
[86.83-87.13]  to
[87.13-87.49]  arrange
[87.49-87.87]  a
[87.87-88.13]  send
[88.13-88.39] -off
[88.39-88.71]  with
[88.71-88.95]  pink
[88.95-89.71]  balloons.
[96.27-96.93]  Through
[96.93-97.27]  it
[97.27-97.55]  all,
[97.69-97.95]  police
[97.95-98.43]  wondered
[98.43-98.67]  if
[98.67-98.87]  the
[98.87-99.23]  killer
[99.23-99.73]  was
[99.73-100.09]  among
[100.09-100.39]  the
[100.39-100.97]  mourners,
[101.55-101.63]  and
[101.63-101.81]  they
[101.81-101.95]  had
[101.95-102.23]  some
[102.23-102.57]  very
[102.57-103.19]  particular
[103.19-103.79]  questions
[103.79-104.09]  for
[104.09-104.35]  that
[104.35-104.59]  close
[104.59-105.15]  friend,
[105.51-105.75]  Tyler
[105.75-106.47]  Schmolz.
[107.13-107.31]  Three
[107.31-107.63]  days
[107.63-107.97]  after
[107.97-108.19]  the
[108.19-108.53]  funeral,
[108.97-109.23]  Tyler
[109.23-109.55]  found
[109.55-110.15]  himself
[110.15-110.63]  once
[110.63-111.27]  again,
[111.61-111.77]  talking
[111.77-112.09]  with
[112.09-112.75]  police.
[119.60-120.10]  Did
[120.10-120.28]  you
[120.28-120.40]  have
[120.40-120.84]  anybody
[120.84-121.22]  that
[121.22-121.34]  you
[121.34-121.80]  thought
[121.80-122.16]  that
[122.16-122.26]  you
[122.26-122.64]  suspected
[122.64-122.94]  at
[122.94-123.10]  the
[123.10-123.46]  time?
[123.70-123.92]  Back
[123.92-124.16]  then,
[124.36-124.64]  Tyler.
[129.42-129.64]  Now
[129.64-129.82]  they
[129.82-130.08]  had
[130.08-130.36]  the
[130.36-130.74]  final
[130.74-131.46]  answer.
[131.90-132.12]  Or
[132.12-132.44]  did
[132.44-132.90]  they?
[133.36-133.72]  Nothing
[133.72-134.08]  has
[134.08-134.32]  more
[134.32-134.82]  suspense
[134.82-135.18]  than
[135.18-135.42]  a
[135.42-135.66]  date
[135.66-135.94]  line
[135.94-136.54]  mystery.
[136.98-137.10]  And
[137.10-137.24]  no
[137.24-137.42]  one
[137.42-137.72]  wants
[137.72-137.90]  to
[137.90-138.08]  wait
[138.08-138.24]  to
[138.24-138.48]  find
[138.48-138.70]  out
[138.70-138.94]  what
[138.94-139.18]  happens
[139.18-139.74]  next.
[140.04-140.42]  That's
[140.42-140.60]  why
[140.60-141.06]  everyone
[141.06-141.50]  needs
