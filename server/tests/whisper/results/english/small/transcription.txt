[65.52-66.04]  Rice's
[66.04-66.24]  name
[66.24-66.58]  came
[66.58-66.82]  up.
[67.22-67.46]  I
[67.46-68.06]  overheard
[68.06-68.64]  Nicole's
[68.64-68.92]  mom
[68.92-69.70]  asking,
[69.88-70.08]  how

[70.76-70.98]  daughter
[70.98-71.24]  did
[71.24-71.66]  this?
[73.64-74.32]  We
[74.32-74.46]  were
[74.46-75.04]  dispatched

[76.36-76.80]  entering

[79.68-79.96]  had

[83.52-84.20]  There
[84.20-86.32]  were
[86.32-86.74]  many
[86.74-87.28]  possible
[87.28-87.86]  suspects.

[97.66-97.98]  18
[97.98-98.38]  years.
[99.07-99.47]  It's
[99.47-99.93]  really
[99.93-100.51]  scary

[109.97-110.47]  solve
[110.47-110.69]  the

[219.86-220.02]  think
[220.02-220.30]  that's
[220.30-220.44]  kind
[220.44-220.52]  of
[220.52-220.64]  all
[220.64-220.74]  I
[220.74-220.88]  can
[220.88-221.16]  say.
[221.44-221.62]  It's
[221.62-221.76]  so
[221.76-222.12]  quiet.
[222.62-222.86]  My
[222.86-222.98]  dad
[222.98-223.16]  was
[223.16-223.26]  a
[223.26-223.38]  mayor
[223.38-223.60]  for
[223.60-223.82]  12
[223.82-224.06]  years
[224.06-224.34]  in
[224.34-224.74]  Butte.
[224.92-224.98]  My
[224.98-225.22]  friends
[225.22-225.38]  would
[225.38-225.54]  come
[225.54-225.80]  over
[225.80-225.98]  and
[225.98-226.26]  have
[226.26-226.88]  sleepovers
[226.88-227.16]  and
[227.16-227.28]  like
[227.28-227.44]  my
[227.44-227.70]  dad
[227.70-227.84]  the
[227.84-228.04]  mayor
[228.04-228.20]  would
[228.20-228.42]  wake
[228.42-228.62]  us
[228.62-228.78]  up
[228.78-228.92]  to
[228.92-229.06]  go
[229.06-229.22]  like
[229.22-229.44]  hang

[230.58-230.90]  on
[230.90-231.08]  Main
[231.08-231.40]  Street.
[231.60-231.76]  Like
[231.76-232.32]  it
[232.32-233.16]  wasn't
[233.16-233.32]  that
[233.32-233.64]  fun.
[234.36-234.76]  That's
[234.76-234.82]  what
[234.82-234.90]  you
[234.90-235.06]  do
[235.06-235.20]  when
[235.20-235.30]  you're
[235.30-235.38]  the
[235.38-235.64]  mayor's
[235.64-235.82]  kids.
[236.16-236.16]  Yeah,
[236.26-236.46]  yeah.
[237.16-237.56]  Anna's
[237.56-237.70]  big
[237.70-238.08]  sister
[238.08-238.46]  Anita

[3.32-3.56]  North
[3.56-3.86]  Dakota

[5.12-5.56]  Anita's
[5.56-5.80]  aunt,
[6.02-6.22]  Karen
[6.22-6.60]  Lear,
[6.90-7.14]  lived
[7.14-7.42]  there
[7.42-7.76]  too.
[8.20-8.38]  How
[8.38-8.72]  excited
[8.72-8.98]  was
[8.98-9.18]  she
[9.18-9.42]  for
[9.42-9.76]  college?
[10.14-10.32]  Very
[10.32-10.54]  much
[10.54-10.80]  so.
[11.16-11.40]  And
[11.40-12.08]  she
[12.08-12.32]  also
[12.32-12.72]  worked
[12.72-12.90]  a
[12.90-13.06]  couple

[13.82-13.96]  in
[13.96-14.30]  Minot
[14.30-14.54]  too.
[14.88-15.06]  Some
[15.06-15.16]  of
[15.16-15.22]  the
[15.22-15.52]  weekends
[15.52-15.82]  she
[15.82-15.96]  would
[15.96-16.08]  go
[16.08-16.28]  back
[16.28-16.44]  to
[16.44-16.94]  Butte
[16.94-17.18]  and
[17.18-17.38]  help
[17.38-17.54]  her
[17.54-17.76]  mom
[17.76-18.00]  in
[18.00-18.14]  the
[18.14-18.38]  store.
[18.70-18.98]  She
[18.98-19.04]  and
[19.04-19.12]  my
[19.12-19.30]  mom
[19.30-19.66]  talked
[19.66-20.14]  every
[20.14-20.36]  single
[20.36-20.58]  day
[20.58-20.68]  on
[20.68-20.78]  the
[20.78-21.10]  phone.
[21.50-21.72]  Even
[21.72-21.88]  when
[21.88-21.98]  she
[21.98-22.08]  went
[22.08-22.18]  to
[22.18-22.44]  college?
[22.70-22.86]  Yeah,
[22.92-23.08]  even
[23.08-23.18]  when
[23.18-23.26]  she
[23.26-23.34]  went
[23.34-23.42]  to
[23.42-23.80]  college.
[23.98-24.10]  She
[24.10-24.12]  was
[24.12-24.38]  always
[24.38-24.96]  calling
[24.96-25.20]  my
[25.20-25.48]  mom.
[25.74-25.84]  She
[25.84-25.94]  was
[25.94-26.06]  such
[26.06-26.12]  a
[26.12-26.28]  hard
[26.28-26.56]  worker,
[26.72-26.84]  but
[26.84-26.96]  she
[26.96-27.12]  still
[27.12-27.26]  made
[27.26-27.52]  time
[27.52-27.70]  for
[27.70-27.84]  her
[27.84-28.04]  friend
[28.04-28.20]  and
[28.20-28.36]  for
[28.36-28.46]  her
[28.46-28.70]  family.
[29.15-29.41]  So
[29.41-29.61]  when
[29.61-30.05]  Anita's
[30.05-30.43]  family
[30.43-30.79]  didn't
[30.79-31.03]  hear
[31.03-31.25]  from
[31.25-31.49]  her
[31.49-31.93]  one
[31.93-32.31]  weekend
[32.31-32.65]  in
[32.65-32.87]  June
[32.87-33.73]  2007,
[34.11-34.55]  they
[34.55-34.95]  figured
[34.95-35.37]  she
[35.37-35.55]  was
[35.55-35.69]  at
[35.69-36.03]  work,
[36.67-36.91]  at
[36.91-37.29]  least
[37.29-37.99]  at
[37.99-38.43]  first.
[39.91-40.55]  Saturday
[40.55-41.17]  passed,
[41.95-42.45]  then
[42.45-43.27]  Sunday.
[44.21-44.31]  Was
[44.31-44.57]  it
[44.57-45.15]  out
[45.15-45.27]  of
[45.27-45.73]  character
[45.73-46.21]  for
[46.21-46.39]  them
[46.39-46.57]  to
[46.57-46.77]  not
[46.77-47.09]  hear
[47.09-47.35]  from
[47.35-47.61]  Anita?
[47.73-47.85]  Very
[47.85-48.13]  much
[48.13-48.39]  so,
[48.63-48.97]  absolutely.
[49.99-50.27]  By
[50.27-50.69]  Monday,
[51.07-51.19]  with
[51.19-51.47]  no
[51.47-51.83]  word
[51.83-52.09]  from
[52.09-52.47]  Anita,
[53.01-53.15]  her
[53.15-53.33]  dad
[53.33-53.79]  Gordon
[53.79-54.17]  made
[54.17-54.37]  the
[54.37-54.69]  hour
[54.69-54.99] -long
[54.99-55.45]  drive
[55.45-55.67]  to
[55.67-55.85]  his
[55.85-56.21]  daughter's
[56.21-56.61]  apartment
[56.61-57.05]  to
[57.05-57.33]  check
[57.33-57.57]  on
[57.57-57.79]  her.
[58.19-58.59]  When
[58.59-58.73]  he
[58.73-59.03]  peered
[59.03-59.25]  through
[59.25-59.67]  Anita's
[59.67-59.97]  window,
[60.41-60.47]  he
[60.47-60.67]  saw
[60.67-60.87]  her
[60.87-61.29]  lying
[61.29-61.67]  face
[61.67-62.15]  down
[62.15-62.57]  in
[62.57-62.73]  her
[62.73-63.07]  bed.
[63.81-63.91]  The
[63.91-64.25]  apartment
[64.25-64.81]  manager
[64.81-65.03]  led
[65.03-65.23]  him
[65.23-65.71]  inside
[65.71-66.33]  and
[66.33-66.83]  immediately
[66.83-67.47]  called
[67.47-68.19]  911.
[93.59-94.19]  Right
[94.19-94.49]  away,
[94.87-95.33]  Anita's
[95.33-95.57]  dad
[95.57-96.05]  called
[96.05-96.29]  his
[96.29-96.77]  sister,
[97.01-97.33]  Karen.
[104.31-104.91]  When
[104.91-107.33]  she
[107.33-107.79]  arrived,
[107.97-108.17]  police
[108.17-108.55]  were
[108.55-109.13]  already
[109.13-109.43]  on
[109.43-109.55]  the
[109.55-110.03]  scene.
[110.59-110.59]  So
[110.59-110.73]  you
[110.73-110.97]  drive
[110.97-111.17]  up
[111.17-111.31]  to
[111.31-111.43]  the
[111.43-111.83]  apartment
[111.83-112.57]  and
[112.57-112.69]  the
[112.69-112.87]  only
[112.87-113.05]  thing
[113.05-113.19]  that
[113.19-113.33]  you
[113.33-113.59]  know
[113.59-114.15]  is
[114.15-114.53]  that
[114.53-114.81]  she's
[114.81-115.03]  gone.
[116.83-117.05]  I
[117.05-117.57]  can't
[117.57-118.15]  imagine
[118.15-118.61]  Karen
[118.61-119.73]  him
[119.73-120.15]  coming
[120.15-120.41]  to
[120.41-120.67]  check
[120.67-120.89]  on
[120.89-121.19]  Anita
[121.19-122.47]  and
[122.47-122.73]  being
[122.73-122.97]  the
[122.97-123.19]  one
[123.19-123.39]  to
[123.39-123.87]  discover
[123.87-124.37]  that
[124.37-124.57]  she
[124.57-124.73]  had
[124.73-124.87]  been
[124.87-125.23]  killed.
[125.97-126.55]  When
[126.55-126.75]  you
[126.75-126.97]  got
[126.97-127.29]  there
[127.29-127.43]  and
[127.43-127.67]  saw
[127.67-127.95]  him,
[128.63-128.89]  how
[128.89-129.11]  was
[129.11-129.33]  he?
[129.95-130.15]  Oh,
[130.63-130.95]  in
[130.95-131.33]  shock.
[131.83-131.89]  I
[131.89-132.09]  mean,
[132.15-132.61]  it's
[132.61-132.95]  just
[132.95-133.69]  something
[133.69-133.95]  you
[133.95-134.25]  never,
[134.25-134.59]  ever
[134.59-134.99]  can
[134.99-135.41]  prepare
[135.41-135.77]  yourself
[135.77-136.19]  for.
[137.19-137.79]  Karen
[137.79-138.09]  stayed
[138.09-138.33]  on
[138.33-138.47]  the
[138.47-138.89]  scene
[138.89-139.19]  as
[139.19-139.49]  Gordon
[139.49-139.93]  left
[139.93-140.19]  to
[140.19-140.41]  break
[140.41-140.57]  the
[140.57-140.85]  news
[140.85-141.03]  to
[141.03-141.21]  his
[141.21-141.55]  wife
[141.55-142.03]  and
[142.03-142.19]  the
[142.19-142.39]  rest
[142.39-142.55]  of
[142.55-142.63]  the
[142.63-143.01]  family.
[143.69-143.85]  You
[143.85-143.99]  know,
[144.03-144.41]  he's
[144.78-145.28]  waiting
[145.28-145.54]  for
[145.54-145.80]  more
[145.80-146.60]  information
[146.60-147.04]  from
[147.04-147.96]  the
[147.96-148.78]  detectives,
[149.06-149.32]  and
[149.32-149.50]  yet
[149.50-149.68]  he
[149.68-149.90]  knows
[149.90-150.08]  he
[150.08-150.26]  needs
[150.26-150.44]  to
[150.44-150.52]  go
[150.52-150.70]  back
[150.70-150.86]  to
[150.86-151.26]  Butte
[151.26-151.46]  and
[151.46-152.04]  talk
[152.04-152.30]  to
[152.30-152.56]  Sharon
[152.56-153.00]  and
[153.00-153.48]  the
[153.48-153.64]  other
[153.64-153.82]  two
[153.82-154.16]  kids.
[154.66-155.18]  So
[155.18-155.66]  he
[155.66-155.94]  stayed
[155.94-156.18]  for
[156.18-156.34]  a
[156.34-156.72]  while,
[157.08-157.32]  but
[157.32-157.52]  then
[157.52-157.66]  he
[157.66-157.86]  knew
[157.86-158.08]  he
[158.08-158.50]  had
[158.50-158.70]  to
[158.70-158.98]  leave
[158.98-160.30]  and
[160.30-160.72]  go
[160.72-160.90]  do
[160.90-161.16]  that.
[161.44-161.52]  He
[161.52-161.78]  stayed.
[162.24-162.46]  I
[162.46-163.10]  wouldn't
[163.10-163.36]  leave.
[164.96-165.48]  What
[165.48-165.68]  made
[165.68-165.82]  you
[165.82-166.10]  stay?
[166.94-167.10]  I
[167.10-167.74]  couldn't
[167.74-168.04]  leave.
[169.24-169.76]  We
[169.76-170.00]  had
[170.00-170.16]  to
[170.16-170.40]  stay
[170.40-170.60]  there
[170.60-170.82]  for
[170.82-171.04]  her.
[173.26-173.72]  You
[173.72-173.90]  felt
[173.90-174.08]  you
[174.08-174.22]  were
[174.22-174.48]  being
[174.48-174.72]  there
[174.72-174.92]  for
[174.92-175.14]  her.
[176.24-176.72]  Had
[176.72-176.90]  to
[176.90-177.00]  be
[177.00-177.24]  there.
[178.50-178.98]  She
[178.98-179.26]  knew
[179.26-179.50]  in
[179.50-179.74]  that
[179.74-180.24]  instant,
[180.68-181.18]  everything
[181.18-181.60]  had
[181.60-182.26]  changed.
[182.84-182.94]  From
[182.94-183.16]  that
[183.16-183.40]  day
[183.40-183.60]  on,
[183.74-184.02]  when
[184.02-184.20]  it
[184.20-184.30]  got
[184.30-184.48]  to
[184.48-184.58]  be
[184.58-184.88]  dark,
[185.08-185.16]  the
[185.16-185.36]  doors
[185.36-185.64]  were
[185.64-186.06]  definitely
[186.06-186.50]  locked,
[186.64-186.72]  the
[186.72-186.98]  shades
[186.98-187.18]  were
[187.18-187.46]  pulled.
[188.10-188.26]  And
[188.26-188.38]  the
[188.38-188.76]  mystery
[188.76-189.14]  of
[189.14-189.36]  who
[189.36-189.68]  killed
[189.68-190.02]  Anita
[190.02-190.80]  was
[190.80-191.36]  only
[191.36-191.74]  just
[191.74-192.22]  beginning.
[192.80-193.22]  Somebody
[193.22-193.48]  is
[193.48-193.78]  there,
[194.02-194.12]  kind
[194.12-194.28]  of
[194.28-194.42]  in
[194.42-194.58]  her
[194.58-194.92]  face,
[195.26-195.48]  holding
[195.48-195.70]  the
[195.70-195.94]  knife
[195.94-196.18]  to
[196.18-196.32]  her
[196.32-196.56]  neck.
[196.80-196.92]  It
[196.92-197.08]  was
[197.08-197.42]  scary,
[197.54-197.62]  I
[197.62-197.76]  mean,
[197.90-198.00]  because
[198.00-198.58]  anybody
[198.58-198.82]  and
[198.82-199.14]  everybody
[199.14-199.78]  is
[199.78-199.88]  a
[199.88-200.06]  suspect
[200.06-200.36]  to
[200.36-200.52]  me.
[200.80-201.00]  If
[201.00-201.20]  there's
[201.20-201.30]  a
[201.30-201.54]  chance
[201.54-201.78]  that
[201.78-201.88]  you
[201.88-202.18]  crawled
[202.18-202.28]  in
[202.28-202.38]  the
[202.38-202.60]  window
[202.60-202.80]  and
[202.80-202.98]  killed
[202.98-203.28]  this
[203.28-203.46]  girl.
[203.94-204.38]  No,
[204.48-204.54]  I
[204.54-204.84]  can't,
[204.88-204.96]  bro.
[205.18-205.48]  That's
[205.48-206.04]  my
[206.04-206.18]  order,
[206.24-206.42]  man.
[207.20-207.62]  It
[207.62-207.72]  was
[207.72-208.12]  pressure
[208.12-208.34]  from
[208.34-208.50]  a
[208.50-208.74]  TV
[208.74-209.10]  show.
[209.40-209.50]  They
[209.50-209.64]  put
[209.64-209.78]  an
[209.78-210.16]  incredible
[210.16-210.54]  amount
[210.54-210.64]  of
[210.64-210.98]  pressure
[210.98-211.54]  to
[211.54-211.80]  bring
[211.80-212.18]  charges
[212.18-212.44]  in
[212.44-212.66]  this
[212.66-212.82]  case.
[228.52-228.96]  David
[228.96-229.46]  Goodman.
[229.72-229.94]  A

[232.92-233.54]  had
[233.54-233.72]  a
[233.72-233.96]  lot
[233.96-234.20]  to
[234.20-234.42]  think
[234.42-234.84]  about
[234.84-235.12]  as
[235.12-235.24]  he
[235.24-235.42]  made
[235.42-235.58]  his
[235.58-235.76]  way
[235.76-235.94]  to
[235.94-236.06]  the

[236.48-236.92]  where
[236.92-237.14]  Anita
[237.14-237.80]  Knutson
[237.80-237.98]  was
[237.98-238.38]  murdered.

--- Chunk 2 ---
[0.00-0.76]  unexplained
[0.76-1.12]  death
[1.12-1.42]  of
[1.42-1.56]  a
[1.56-1.98]  promising
[1.98-2.30]  young
[2.30-2.68]  college
[2.68-3.12]  student
[3.12-3.80]  was
[3.80-4.36]  virtually
[4.36-5.08]  unheard
[5.08-5.44]  of
[5.44-5.60]  in
[5.60-5.98]  Minot,
[6.10-6.22]  North
[6.22-6.74]  Dakota.
[7.62-8.10]  So
[8.10-8.24]  as
[8.24-8.40]  you're
[8.40-8.50]  on
[8.50-8.62]  your
[8.62-8.78]  way
[8.78-9.00]  there,
[9.42-9.58]  what
[9.58-9.66]  are
[9.66-9.78]  you
[9.78-10.06]  thinking?
[10.62-10.80]  I
[10.80-10.98]  was
[10.98-11.22]  new
[11.22-11.46]  to
[11.46-12.18]  investigations,
[12.60-12.72]  kind
[12.72-12.84]  of
[12.84-13.02]  wondered
[13.02-13.26]  what
[13.26-13.60]  direction
[13.60-13.96]  we'd
[13.96-14.14]  go
[14.14-14.38]  in
[14.38-14.56]  and
[14.56-14.86]  are
[14.86-15.00]  we
[15.00-15.08]  going
[15.08-15.14]  to
[15.14-15.38]  solve
[15.38-15.64]  this
[15.64-15.84]  right
[15.84-16.16]  away?
[16.32-16.42]  Is
[16.42-16.52]  it
[16.52-16.60]  going
[16.60-16.66]  to
[16.66-16.76]  be
[16.76-17.18]  difficult?
[18.48-18.60]  On
[18.60-18.82]  that
[18.82-19.04]  early
[19.04-19.46]  evening
[19.46-19.70]  in
[19.70-20.02]  June,
[20.42-20.64]  Sergeant
[20.64-21.12]  Goodman
[21.12-21.38]  knew
[21.38-21.78]  very
[21.78-22.18]  little
[22.18-22.46]  when
[22.46-22.62]  he
[22.62-23.00]  arrived
[23.00-23.14]  at
[23.14-23.58]  Anita's
[23.58-24.00]  apartment.
[29.55-30.01]  So
[30.01-30.15]  when
[30.15-30.27]  you
[30.27-30.53]  got
[30.53-31.01]  here
[31.01-31.21]  to
[31.21-31.37]  the
[31.37-31.57]  scene
[31.57-31.79]  that
[31.79-32.13]  day,
[32.39-32.55]  what
[32.55-32.65]  did
[32.65-32.77]  you
[32.77-32.97]  see?
[33.89-34.15]  I
[34.15-34.37]  believe
[34.37-34.63]  they
[34.63-34.87]  had
[34.87-35.21]  police
[35.21-35.53]  tape
[35.53-35.77]  up
[35.77-36.19]  already.
[36.81-37.25]  The
[37.25-37.47]  crime
[37.47-37.75]  scene
[37.75-38.01]  van
[38.01-38.19]  was
[38.19-38.41]  parked
[38.41-38.63]  on
[38.63-38.73]  the
[38.73-38.99]  grass
[38.99-39.25]  right
[39.25-39.43]  out
[39.43-39.57]  in
[39.57-39.67]  front
[39.67-39.79]  of
[39.79-39.89]  the
[39.89-40.13]  door
[40.13-41.15]  and
[41.15-41.99]  detectives
[41.99-42.15]  were
[42.15-42.47]  inside
[42.47-42.71]  the
[42.71-43.05]  apartment.
[43.41-43.51]  Is
[43.51-43.65]  that
[43.65-43.77]  the
[43.77-43.97]  front
[43.97-44.19]  door
[44.19-44.47]  right
[44.47-44.51]  there?
[44.79-44.79]  Yes,
[44.83-45.09]  that's
[45.09-45.23]  the
[45.23-45.47]  front
[45.47-45.67]  and
[45.67-45.91]  only
[45.91-46.23]  door
[46.23-46.71]  going
[46.71-46.95]  into
[46.95-47.27]  apartment
[47.27-47.55]  number
[47.55-47.93]  five.
[48.65-48.77]  The
[48.77-49.05]  bedroom
[49.05-49.59]  window
[49.59-49.97]  caught
[49.97-50.21]  his
[50.21-50.59]  eye.
[50.97-51.13]  What
[51.13-51.21]  did
[51.21-51.31]  you
[51.31-51.53]  notice
[51.53-51.87]  about
[51.87-52.25]  her
[52.25-52.55]  window?
[53.11-53.39]  I
[53.39-53.59]  noticed
[53.59-53.85]  that
[53.85-54.01]  the
[54.01-54.27]  screen
[54.27-54.51]  was
[54.51-54.85]  gone.
[55.81-56.03]  An
[56.03-56.47]  important
[56.47-57.09]  detail?
[57.60-58.04]  That
[58.04-58.64]  remained
[58.64-58.90]  to
[58.90-59.06]  be
[59.06-59.48]  seen.
[60.56-60.76]  As
[60.76-61.06]  police
[61.06-61.50]  began
[61.50-62.10]  processing
[62.10-62.32]  the
[62.32-62.60]  crime
[62.60-63.06]  scene,
[63.76-64.16]  Anita's
[64.16-64.44]  father,
[64.82-65.12]  Gordon,
[65.60-65.70]  had
[65.70-66.02]  begun
[66.02-66.24]  the
[66.24-66.52]  grim
[66.52-66.94]  duty
[66.94-67.36]  of
[67.36-67.64]  telling
[67.64-67.90]  his
[67.90-68.36]  family.
[69.32-69.78]  Anita's
[69.78-70.12]  15
[70.12-70.32] -year
[70.32-70.46] -old
[70.46-70.82]  sister,
[71.06-71.32]  Anna,
[71.70-71.88]  got
[71.88-72.04]  the
[72.04-72.28]  news
[72.28-72.46]  from
[72.46-72.64]  her
[72.64-72.96]  brother.
[73.80-74.10]  Daniel
[74.10-74.38]  comes
[74.38-74.56]  to
[74.56-74.70]  pick
[74.70-74.84]  me
[74.84-75.10]  up,
[75.30-75.32]  and
[75.32-75.82]  I
[75.82-75.94]  get
[75.94-76.04]  in
[76.04-76.12]  the
[76.12-76.46]  car,
[76.74-76.78]  and
[76.78-77.66]  I
[77.66-77.78]  could
[77.78-77.96]  tell
[77.96-78.16]  he'd
[78.16-78.28]  been
[78.28-78.70]  crying.
[79.32-79.48]  Like,
[79.62-80.06]  something
[80.06-80.30]  was
[80.30-80.58]  very
[80.58-80.98]  wrong,
[81.54-81.68]  and
[81.68-81.76]  I
[81.76-81.84]  was
[81.84-81.96]  like,
[82.00-82.08]  well,
[82.10-82.32]  what's
[82.32-82.50]  going
[82.50-82.84]  on?
[83.18-83.42]  And
[83.42-83.64]  he's
[83.64-83.78]  like,
[83.84-83.94]  and
[83.94-84.04]  I
[84.04-84.32]  can't
[84.32-84.48]  tell
[84.48-84.70]  you.
[85.84-86.36]  Finally,
[86.68-86.80]  he
[86.80-87.14]  spoke
[87.14-87.36]  the
[87.36-87.82]  words.
[89.32-89.56]  Anita
[89.56-90.54]  was
[90.54-91.02]  dead.
[91.80-92.00]  This
[92.00-92.26]  is,
[92.28-92.48]  of
[92.48-92.62]  course,
[92.76-92.88]  my
[92.88-93.08]  first
[93.08-93.42]  time
[93.42-94.10]  with
[94.10-94.32]  any
[94.32-94.58]  type
[94.58-94.76]  of
[94.76-95.02]  grief
[95.02-95.34]  at
[95.34-95.46]  this
[95.46-95.82]  level.
[96.40-96.40]  But
[96.40-96.52]  I
[96.52-96.90]  learned
[96.90-97.48]  about
[97.48-97.86]  myself
[97.86-98.10]  in
[98.10-98.24]  that
[98.24-98.58]  moment.
[98.82-98.92]  Like,
[98.96-98.98]  I
[98.98-99.12]  don't
[99.12-99.42]  want
[99.42-99.72]  people
[99.72-100.20]  around.
[100.52-100.60]  I
[100.60-100.80]  don't
[100.80-101.16]  want
[101.16-101.86]  people
[101.86-102.10]  coming
[102.10-102.34]  in
[102.34-102.48]  to
[102.48-102.72]  ask
[102.72-102.98]  me
[102.98-103.54]  if
[103.54-103.70]  I'm
[103.70-103.96]  OK
[103.96-104.28]  every
[104.28-104.48]  five
[104.48-105.00]  seconds,
[105.00-105.44]  especially
[105.44-105.80]  people
[105.80-106.08]  that
[106.08-106.36]  don't
[106.36-106.58]  know
[106.58-106.82]  me.
[107.72-108.16]  Daniel
[108.16-108.62]  was
[108.62-109.16]  also
[109.16-109.52]  taking
[109.52-109.74]  it
[109.74-110.12]  hard.
[110.76-110.94]  I
[110.94-111.20]  understand
[111.20-111.48]  that
[111.48-111.78]  Daniel
[111.78-112.00]  and
[112.00-112.34]  Anita
[112.34-113.00]  had
[113.00-113.12]  a
[113.12-113.36]  very
[113.36-113.78]  special
[113.78-114.50]  relationship.
[114.72-114.82]  They
[114.82-114.98]  did.
[115.28-115.66]  They
[115.66-116.22]  were
[116.22-116.46]  very
[116.46-116.74]  close.
[117.58-117.94]  Gordon
[117.94-118.20]  and
[118.20-118.36]  his
[118.36-118.54]  wife
[118.54-118.96]  Sharon
[118.96-119.56]  adopted
[119.56-119.84]  the
[119.84-120.04]  three
[120.04-120.40]  siblings
[120.40-120.90]  when
[120.90-121.06]  they
[121.06-121.20]  were
[121.20-121.50]  all
[121.50-121.84]  very
[121.84-122.34]  young.
[123.16-123.30]  They
[123.30-123.46]  spent
[123.46-123.72]  their
[123.72-124.02]  early
[124.02-124.52]  childhood
[124.52-124.98]  in
[124.98-125.40]  sunny
[125.40-125.78]  Southern
[125.78-126.54]  California.
[127.22-127.30]  It
[127.30-127.42]  was
[127.42-127.54]  a
[127.54-127.68]  fun
[127.68-127.86]  little
[127.86-128.26]  childhood,
[128.44-128.68]  yeah.
[129.58-129.84]  Lauren
[129.84-130.30]  Lessig
[130.30-130.50]  and
[130.50-130.76]  Anita
[130.76-131.44]  became
[131.44-132.04]  forever
[132.04-132.72]  friends
[132.72-133.16]  in
[133.16-133.56]  kindergarten.
[134.52-135.16]  What
[135.16-136.22]  was
[136.22-136.32]  it
[136.32-136.48]  about
[136.48-136.70]  Anita
[136.70-137.06]  that
[137.06-137.32]  just
[137.32-137.66]  really
[137.66-137.90]  drew
[137.90-138.10]  you
[138.10-138.26]  to
[138.26-138.46]  her?
[138.96-139.30]  She
[139.30-139.46]  was
[139.46-139.64]  just
[139.64-140.66]  positive
[140.66-140.94]  and
[140.94-141.26]  happy
[141.26-141.64]  and
[141.64-141.98]  just
[142.60-143.08]  the
[143.08-143.40]  best.
[143.58-143.58]  I
[143.58-143.72]  mean,
[143.74-143.86]  she
[143.86-144.16]  always
[144.16-144.48]  did
[144.48-144.70]  what
[144.70-144.92]  was
[144.92-145.22]  right.
[145.64-145.92]  She
[145.92-146.62]  never,
[146.64-147.80]  like,
[148.00-148.26]  wavered
[148.26-148.38]  in
[148.38-148.64]  that.
[149.24-149.60]  Then,
[149.90-150.06]  when
[150.06-150.24]  Anita
[150.24-150.58]  was
[150.58-150.98]  almost
[150.98-151.54]  14,
[152.08-152.26]  Gordon
[152.26-152.74]  decided
[152.74-153.04]  to
[153.04-153.20]  move
[153.20-153.36]  the
[153.36-153.74]  family
[153.74-154.06]  up
[154.06-154.42]  North
[154.42-154.96]  to
[154.96-155.18]  his
[155.18-155.68]  hometown
[155.68-156.24]  of
[156.24-156.82]  Butte.
[157.44-157.62]  One
[157.62-157.88]  day,
[158.10-158.90]  your
[158.90-159.04]  dad
[159.04-159.28]  comes
[159.28-159.50]  in
[159.50-159.66]  and
[159.66-159.90]  says,
[160.38-160.74]  we're
[160.74-160.92]  moving
[160.92-161.08]  to
[161.08-161.18]  North
[161.18-161.46]  Dakota.
[161.86-162.08]  Yeah,
[162.32-162.54]  Southern
[162.54-162.94]  California
[162.94-163.22]  is
[163.22-163.40]  such,
[163.60-163.84]  it's
[163.84-164.34]  obviously
[164.34-164.78]  very
[164.78-165.24]  different
[165.24-165.54]  than
[165.54-166.20]  North
[166.20-166.58]  Central
[166.58-166.76]  and
[166.76-166.86]  North
[166.86-167.32]  Dakota,
[167.44-167.58]  for
[167.58-167.82]  sure.
[168.24-168.44]  For
[168.44-168.70]  Anita,
[169.00-169.12]  I
[169.12-169.24]  think
[169.24-169.44]  it
[169.44-169.72]  was
[169.72-170.50]  really
[170.50-170.86]  hard.
[171.08-171.14]  I
[171.14-171.30]  mean,
[171.63-172.01]  friendship
[172.01-172.21]  was
[172.21-172.35]  so
[172.35-172.63]  important
[172.63-172.85]  to
[172.85-172.97]  her
[172.97-173.25]  and
[173.25-173.63]  and
[173.63-173.81]  leaving
[173.81-174.03]  all
[174.03-174.13]  of
[174.13-174.23]  her
[174.23-174.43]  friends
[174.43-174.83]  behind
[174.83-175.31]  and
[175.31-175.63]  I
[175.63-175.71]  mean
[175.71-175.89]  she
[175.89-176.01]  was
[176.01-176.09]  it
[176.09-176.19]  was
[176.19-176.29]  a
[176.29-176.53]  tough
[176.53-177.07]  age
[177.07-177.37]  too.
[177.51-177.61]  I
[177.61-177.69]  mean
[177.69-177.83]  we
[177.83-177.99]  went
[177.99-178.15]  from
[178.15-178.49]  being
[178.49-178.83]  you
[178.83-178.99]  know
[178.99-179.39]  like
[179.39-180.13]  being
[180.13-180.23]  in
[180.23-180.33]  a
[180.33-180.55]  school
[180.55-181.01]  where
[181.01-181.73]  lots
[181.73-181.87]  of
[181.87-182.05]  kids
[182.05-182.25]  look
[182.25-182.47]  like
[182.47-182.83]  us
[182.83-183.09]  to
[183.09-183.79]  being
[183.79-183.89]  in
[183.89-183.99]  a
[183.99-184.19]  school
[184.19-184.61]  where
[184.61-185.09]  we're
[185.09-185.19]  the
[185.19-185.39]  only
[185.39-185.75]  three
[185.75-186.21]  black

[186.37-186.51]  brown
[186.51-186.87]  kids
[186.87-187.19]  there
[187.19-187.73]  is
[187.73-188.27]  pretty
[188.27-189.65]  jarring
[189.65-189.99]  to
[189.99-190.15]  say
[190.15-190.29]  the
[190.29-190.59]  least.
[190.93-191.19]  How
[191.19-191.29]  did
[191.29-191.45]  she
[191.45-191.73]  overcome
[191.73-192.09]  that?
[192.43-192.59]  You
[192.59-192.69]  know
[192.69-192.87]  I
[192.87-193.03]  think
[193.03-193.29]  for
[193.29-193.59]  Anita
[193.59-194.21]  she
[194.21-196.03]  was
[196.03-196.35]  always
[196.35-196.71]  good
[196.71-196.91]  with
[196.91-197.39]  challenges
[197.39-197.83]  like
[197.83-198.07]  she
[198.07-198.49]  there's
[198.49-198.71]  really
[198.71-198.97]  nothing
[198.97-199.21]  that
[199.21-199.33]  she
[199.33-199.97]  couldn't
[199.97-200.73]  make
[200.73-200.89]  it
[200.89-201.15]  through.
[201.48-201.68]  What
[201.68-201.82]  was
[201.82-201.90]  your
[201.90-202.14]  first
[202.14-202.64]  impression
[202.64-203.00]  of
[203.00-203.14]  Anita?
[203.92-204.16]  Just
[204.16-204.36]  a
[204.36-204.88]  teeny
[204.88-205.42]  tiny

[205.96-206.68]  ball
[206.68-206.86]  of
[206.86-207.24]  energy
[207.24-207.38]  and
[207.38-207.72]  sunshine.

[213.94-214.06]  she
[214.06-214.28]  thought
[214.28-214.62]  Anita

[9.96-10.38]  It

[10.54-10.70]  getting
[10.70-10.98]  kind

[12.46-13.14]  Larissa
[13.14-13.64]  Rao

[14.22-14.94]  Anita's
[14.94-15.44]  can
[15.44-15.80] -do
[15.80-16.48]  generous
[16.48-17.00]  spirit.
[17.86-18.18]  She
[18.18-18.56]  literally
[18.56-18.94]  became
[18.94-19.28]  friends

[26.08-26.20]  of

[26.72-26.86]  So

[45.24-45.48]  a
[45.48-45.66]  semester
[45.66-46.04]  in
[46.04-46.14]  the
[46.14-46.80]  dorms,
[46.86-47.04]  Anita
[47.04-47.50]  and
[47.50-47.66]  one
[47.66-47.78]  of
[47.78-47.92]  her
[47.92-48.34]  roommates,
[48.72-48.90]  Nicole
[48.90-49.44]  Thomas,
[49.86-50.22]  decided
[50.22-50.46]  to
[50.46-50.72]  move
[50.72-51.06]  off
[51.06-51.50]  campus.
[52.24-52.54]  I
[52.54-52.78]  think
[52.78-53.00]  they
[53.00-53.24]  just
[53.24-53.58]  wanted
[53.58-54.66]  to
[54.66-54.86]  have
[54.86-55.06]  their
[55.06-55.20]  own
[55.20-55.52]  space.
[55.70-55.94]  So
[55.94-56.16]  then
[56.16-56.34]  they
[56.34-56.48]  were
[56.48-56.80]  both
[57.12-57.38]  Like,
[57.42-57.64]  let's
[57.64-57.74]  just
[57.74-57.88]  get
[57.88-57.98]  an
[57.98-58.20]  apartment
[58.20-58.72]  together,
[58.74-58.96]  so
[58.96-59.14]  they
[59.14-59.36]  did.
[61.22-61.68]  Anita's
[61.68-62.12]  apartment
[62.12-62.60]  had
[62.60-62.92]  become
[62.92-63.14]  a
[63.14-63.42]  crime
[63.42-63.84]  scene.
[64.62-64.82]  Those
[64.82-65.04]  who
[65.04-65.34]  knew
[65.34-65.54]  and
[65.54-65.80]  loved
[65.80-66.04]  her
[66.04-66.36]  gathered
[66.36-67.02]  outside
[67.02-67.94]  brimming
[67.94-68.20]  with
[68.20-68.62]  questions
[68.62-68.92]  for
[68.92-69.40]  police.
[70.56-70.78]  And
[70.78-71.08]  police
[71.08-71.40]  would
[71.40-71.56]  have
[71.56-72.00]  questions
[72.00-72.36]  for
[72.36-72.68]  some
[72.68-72.86]  of
[72.86-73.16]  them
[73.16-73.78]  about
[73.78-74.20]  Anita,
[74.80-74.90]  her
[74.90-75.30]  life,
[75.70-76.22]  and
[76.22-76.34]  the
[76.34-76.62]  people
[76.62-76.86]  who
[76.86-77.34]  surrounded
[77.34-77.66]  her.
[78.34-78.62]  She
[78.62-78.80]  got
[78.80-78.96]  any
[78.96-79.26]  guys
[79.26-79.50]  or
[79.50-79.78]  anything
[79.78-80.04]  that
[80.04-80.36]  she's
[80.36-80.82]  interested
[80.82-81.02]  in
[81.02-81.14]  or
[81.14-81.26]  that
[81.26-81.38]  are
[81.38-81.82]  interested
[81.82-82.04]  in
[82.04-82.26]  her?
[83.48-83.72]  I
[83.72-83.84]  don't
[83.84-83.94]  know.
[84.00-84.10]  She
[84.10-84.26]  was
[84.26-84.50]  going
[84.50-84.70]  to
[84.70-84.96]  jail,
[85.16-85.84]  so...
[90.44-90.96]  Do
[90.96-91.48]  you
[91.48-93.30]  have

[95.90-96.42]  Wait,
[96.54-96.56]  did
[96.56-96.70]  you
[96.70-96.70]  say

[192.64-192.84]  about
[192.84-193.06]  this
[193.06-193.40]  apartment?
[193.66-193.80]  Just
[193.80-194.00]  the
[194.00-194.24]  layout,
[194.44-194.54]  how
[194.54-194.70]  many
[194.70-195.06]  bedrooms
[195.06-195.34]  it
[195.34-195.56]  was,

[196.46-196.58]  the

[197.28-197.48]  what
[197.48-197.68]  was
[197.68-197.84]  out
[197.84-197.92]  of
[197.92-198.22]  place.
[199.22-199.60]  There,
[199.72-199.86]  in
[199.86-199.94]  a
[199.94-200.28]  bedroom,
[200.72-201.22]  clothed
[201.22-201.32]  in
[201.32-201.44]  a
[201.44-201.64]  pink
[201.64-202.30]  bathrobe,
[202.59-202.87]  He
[202.87-203.17]  saw
[203.17-203.69]  Anita's
[203.69-204.07]  body
[204.07-204.81]  still
[204.81-205.11]  on
[205.11-205.23]  the
[205.23-205.57]  bed.
[206.09-206.23]  I
[206.23-206.39]  could
[206.39-206.59]  see
[206.59-206.83]  that
[206.83-207.15]  she
[207.15-208.17]  was
[208.17-208.63]  kind
[208.63-208.77]  of
[208.77-209.21]  flopped
[209.21-209.53]  over
[209.53-209.97]  laying
[209.97-210.17]  on
[210.17-210.33]  her
[210.33-210.69]  stomach.
[211.03-211.17]  I
[211.17-211.43]  noticed
[211.43-211.71]  her
[211.71-212.17]  room
[212.17-212.73]  seemed
[212.73-212.93]  to
[212.93-213.03]  be
[213.03-213.17]  in
[213.17-213.49]  order.
[213.85-213.99]  So
[213.99-214.11]  it
[214.11-214.27]  didn't
[214.27-214.51]  seem
[214.51-214.79]  like
[214.79-214.97]  there
[214.97-215.07]  had
[215.07-215.19]  been
[215.19-215.29]  a
[215.29-215.63]  struggle.
[216.01-216.21]  No.
[216.73-216.95]  There
[216.95-217.09]  did
[217.09-217.31]  not
[217.31-217.65]  seem
[217.65-217.79]  to
[217.79-217.91]  be
[217.91-217.99]  a
[217.99-218.31]  struggle
[218.31-218.49]  at
[218.49-218.65]  all.
[219.31-219.81]  I
[219.81-219.91]  had
[219.91-220.17]  also
[220.17-220.41]  looked
[220.41-220.71]  around
[220.71-221.09]  her
[221.09-221.63]  bedroom
[221.63-222.03]  and
[222.03-222.15]  I
[222.15-222.37]  noticed
[222.37-222.65]  that
[222.65-222.81]  her
[222.81-223.11]  purse
[223.11-223.37]  was
[223.37-223.67]  there.
[224.19-224.37]  I
[224.37-224.53]  could
[224.53-224.77]  see
[224.77-224.99]  that
[224.99-225.15]  there
[225.15-225.31]  was
[225.31-225.59]  cash
[225.59-225.87]  in
[225.87-226.03]  her
[226.03-226.47]  purse.
[226.65-226.99]  So
[226.99-227.11]  I
[227.11-227.33]  didn't
[227.33-227.57]  feel
[227.57-227.91]  like
[227.91-228.43]  it
[228.43-228.57]  had
[228.57-228.73]  been
[228.73-228.95]  any
[228.95-229.19]  sort
[229.19-229.87]  of
[229.87-230.09]  a
[230.09-230.69]  burglary
[230.69-231.09]  or
[231.09-231.23]  a
[231.23-231.57]  robbery.
[232.16-232.44]  gone
[232.44-232.76]  bad
[232.76-233.06]  type
[233.06-233.20]  of
[233.20-233.84]  situation.
[234.24-234.70]  They
[234.70-235.00]  moved
[235.00-235.44]  Anita's
[235.44-235.74]  body
[235.74-236.02]  to
[236.02-236.14]  the
[236.14-236.52]  floor.
[237.02-237.18]  We
[237.18-237.34]  could
[237.34-237.58]  see
[237.58-237.84]  that
[237.84-238.04]  she
[238.04-238.32]  had
[238.32-238.48]  a
[238.48-238.80]  stab
[238.80-239.22]  wound
[239.22-239.68]  to
[239.68-239.96]  her.

[0.00-0.62]  right
[0.62-1.26]  chest
[1.26-1.76]  area
[1.76-2.74]  and
[2.74-3.02]  also
[3.02-3.22]  a
[3.22-3.34]  stab
[3.34-3.74]  wound
[3.74-4.38]  to
[4.38-4.80]  her
[4.80-5.54]  sternum
[5.54-5.86]  area.
[6.30-6.94]  And
[6.94-7.08]  then
[7.08-7.24]  we
[7.24-7.50]  also
[7.50-7.84]  noticed
[7.84-8.08]  on
[8.08-8.20]  the
[8.20-8.62]  mattress
[8.62-9.20]  that
[9.20-9.40]  there
[9.40-9.64]  was
[9.64-9.96]  a
[9.96-10.46]  five
[10.46-10.66]  to
[10.66-10.90]  six
[10.90-11.14]  inch
[11.14-11.60]  circle
[11.60-11.82]  of
[11.82-12.08]  blood
[12.08-12.40]  where
[12.40-12.68]  blood
[12.68-12.86]  had
[12.86-13.16]  drained
[13.16-13.40]  from
[13.40-13.58]  her
[13.58-13.90]  body
[13.90-14.08]  and
[14.08-14.32]  soaked
[14.32-14.62]  into
[14.62-14.76]  the
[14.76-15.14]  mattress.
[16.20-16.62]  Anita
[16.62-17.18]  had
[17.18-17.40]  been
[17.40-17.78]  stabbed
[17.78-18.02]  in
[18.02-18.14]  the
[18.14-18.54]  heart
[18.54-19.26]  and
[19.26-19.38]  the
[19.38-19.68]  evidence
[19.68-20.28]  suggested
[20.28-20.62]  she
[20.62-20.80]  was
[20.80-21.16]  killed
[21.16-21.76]  Sunday,
[22.08-22.26]  the
[22.26-22.44]  day
[22.44-22.86]  before.
[24.16-24.54]  Then,
[24.76-24.98]  right
[24.98-25.20]  by
[25.20-25.70]  Anita's
[25.70-25.94]  bed,
[26.44-26.94]  investigators
[26.94-27.42]  made
[27.42-27.56]  a
[27.56-27.80]  key
[27.80-28.40]  discovery.
[28.96-29.32]  A
[29.32-29.70]  knife
[29.70-30.28]  with
[30.28-30.42]  a
[30.42-30.90]  distinctive
[30.90-31.56]  tribal
[31.56-32.36]  insignia
[32.36-32.52]  on
[32.52-32.72]  one
[32.72-33.20]  side.
[33.86-34.00]  There
[34.00-34.20]  was
[34.20-34.48]  blood
[34.48-34.66]  on
[34.66-34.78]  the
[34.78-35.14]  blade,
[35.32-35.66]  and
[35.66-35.98]  testing
[35.98-36.24]  would
[36.24-36.76]  confirm
[36.76-37.16]  it
[37.16-37.38]  was
[37.38-38.10]  Anita's.
[39.24-39.92]  Investigators
[39.92-40.32]  gathered
[40.32-40.64]  more
[40.64-41.10]  evidence,
[41.52-41.70]  like
[41.70-41.86]  the
[41.86-42.14]  missing
[42.14-42.60]  screen
[42.60-42.86]  from
[42.86-43.34]  Anita's
[43.34-43.68]  window.
[44.34-44.46]  The
[44.46-44.80]  maintenance
[44.80-45.14]  man
[45.14-45.44]  said
[45.44-45.68]  he
[45.68-45.80]  had
[45.80-46.10]  taken
[46.10-46.28]  it
[46.28-46.46]  to
[46.46-46.60]  be
[46.60-46.98]  repaired
[46.98-47.40]  earlier
[47.40-47.74]  that
[47.74-48.14]  day.
[48.78-48.94]  It
[48.94-49.10]  had
[49.10-49.30]  been
[49.30-49.98]  slashed.
[50.56-50.74]  It
[50.74-51.06]  appeared
[51.06-51.34]  that
[51.34-51.82]  somebody
[51.82-52.18]  had
[52.18-52.76]  used
[52.76-52.96]  a
[52.96-53.22]  knife
[53.22-53.50]  and
[53.50-53.84]  cut
[53.84-54.28]  kind
[54.28-54.42]  of
[54.42-54.52]  a
[54.52-55.20]  backwards
[55.20-55.66]  L,
[55.88-56.82]  cut
[56.82-57.20]  into
[57.20-57.38]  the
[57.38-57.70]  screen.
[58.42-58.94]  Is
[58.94-59.18]  that
[59.18-59.40]  how
[59.40-59.54]  the
[59.54-59.76]  killer
[59.76-60.08]  got
[60.08-60.36]  in?
[60.64-60.96]  Or
[60.96-61.12]  did
[61.12-61.64]  someone
[61.64-61.96]  come
[61.96-62.14]  through
[62.14-62.28]  the
[62.28-62.60]  apartment
[62.60-63.10]  door?
[64.04-64.22]  That
[64.22-64.52]  door
[64.52-64.80]  was
[64.80-65.20]  locked
[65.20-65.42]  when
[65.42-65.80]  Anita's
[65.80-66.02]  father
[66.02-66.36]  tried
[66.36-66.54]  to
[66.54-66.80]  enter,
[67.22-67.44]  so
[67.44-67.60]  if
[67.60-67.94]  someone
[67.94-68.20]  came
[68.20-68.42]  in
[68.42-68.60]  that
[68.60-68.90]  way,
[69.16-69.38]  they
[69.38-69.54]  would
[69.54-69.74]  need
[69.74-69.88]  a
[69.88-70.16]  key.
[70.76-71.00]  This
[71.00-71.32]  wasn't
[71.32-71.42]  a
[71.42-71.52]  sort
[71.52-71.66]  of
[71.66-71.86]  lock
[71.86-72.06]  that
[72.06-72.18]  you
[72.18-72.40]  could
[72.40-72.74]  maybe
[72.74-73.14]  pick
[73.14-73.42]  or
[73.42-73.66]  get
[73.66-73.90]  in
[73.90-74.22]  from
[74.22-74.74]  another
[74.74-75.06]  way.
[75.20-75.28]  You
[75.28-75.54]  needed
[75.54-75.70]  an
[75.70-75.96]  actual
[75.96-76.30]  key.
[76.52-76.68]  You
[76.68-76.96]  needed
[76.96-77.14]  a
[77.14-77.36]  key,
[77.50-77.68]  yes.
[78.32-78.50]  A
[78.50-78.78]  key
[78.78-79.06]  to
[79.06-79.50]  unlock
[79.50-79.76]  the
[79.76-80.08]  door
[80.08-80.70]  and
[80.70-81.32]  relock
[81.32-81.56]  it
[81.56-81.74]  on
[81.74-82.24]  departure.
[83.22-83.50]  Four
[83.50-83.88]  people
[83.88-84.18]  had
[84.18-84.44]  keys
[84.44-84.62]  to
[84.62-84.76]  the
[84.76-85.14]  apartment.
[85.66-86.02]  Anita,
[86.60-86.72]  her
[86.72-86.98]  roommate
[86.98-87.40]  Nicole,
[87.87-88.07]  The
[88.07-88.49]  manager
[88.49-89.19]  and
[89.19-89.43]  that
[89.43-89.83]  maintenance
[89.83-90.29]  man,
[90.67-90.85]  Marty
[90.85-91.05]  and
[91.05-91.41]  Nell,
[92.31-92.51]  police
[92.51-92.91]  spoke
[92.91-93.13]  with
[93.13-93.29]  him
[93.29-93.49]  that

[93.75-94.21]  night.
[104.95-105.67]  Into
[105.67-108.79]  the
[108.79-109.11]  same
[109.11-109.67]  room
[109.67-110.09]  where
[110.09-110.47]  Anita
[110.47-111.03]  laid
[111.03-111.43]  dead.
[111.99-112.45]  He
[112.45-112.67]  said
[112.67-112.89]  he
[112.89-113.19]  didn't
[113.19-113.45]  look
[113.45-113.77]  in,
[113.97-114.25]  but
[114.25-114.39]  he
[114.39-114.63]  did
[114.63-114.95]  call
[114.95-115.35]  out.
[115.79-116.07]  No
[116.07-116.43]  answer.
[132.27-132.73]  Just
[132.73-132.87]  in
[132.87-132.99]  those
[132.99-133.19]  first
[133.19-133.53]  initial
[133.53-134.01]  hours,
[134.47-134.83]  was
[134.83-134.97]  he
[134.97-135.15]  ever
[135.15-135.31]  a
[135.31-135.59]  person
[135.59-135.75]  of
[135.75-136.03]  interest
[136.03-136.39]  for
[136.39-136.55]  you?
[137.09-137.37]  He
[137.37-137.79]  was
[137.79-138.33]  a
[138.33-138.65]  person
[138.65-138.85]  of
[138.85-139.41]  interest
[139.41-139.75]  of
[139.75-140.09]  just
[140.09-141.41]  knowing
[141.41-142.03]  that
[142.03-143.55]  he
[143.55-143.93]  had
[143.93-144.49]  knowledge
[144.49-144.93]  of
[144.93-145.31]  what
[145.31-145.47]  was
[145.47-145.71]  going
[145.71-146.35]  on
[146.35-146.57]  there
[146.57-146.73]  or
[146.73-146.85]  what
[146.85-147.19]  happened
[147.19-147.51]  there.
[147.79-147.97]  So,
[148.45-148.77]  of
[148.77-149.03]  course,
[149.25-149.35]  the
[149.35-149.97]  maintenance
[149.97-150.51]  guy
[150.51-150.77]  would
[150.77-151.31]  have
[151.31-151.65]  access
[151.65-151.95]  to
[151.95-152.21]  keys.
[153.09-153.43]  Something
[153.43-153.69]  to
[153.69-154.17]  consider
[154.17-154.63]  as
[154.63-155.03]  police
[155.03-155.41]  dove
[155.41-155.71]  into
[155.71-155.89]  the

[157.07-157.23]  Are

[159.37-159.53]  at
[159.53-159.61]  the
[159.61-159.85]  scene?
[160.27-160.73]  Yes,
[160.99-161.21]  we
[161.21-161.47]  learned
[161.47-161.65]  that
[161.65-161.93]  she

[164.81-165.33]  Anita's
[165.33-165.69]  roommate,
[165.93-166.07]  Nicole
[166.07-166.61]  Thomas,
[166.99-167.15]  was
[167.15-167.29]  at
[167.29-167.63]  work
[167.63-167.89]  when
[167.89-168.19]  police
[168.19-168.61]  asked
[168.61-168.77]  her
[168.77-168.85]  to

[173.03-173.17]  been
[173.17-173.45]  away
[173.45-173.75]  most
[173.75-173.93]  of

[174.31-174.71]  at
[174.71-174.83]  her

[176.07-176.29]  She

[176.49-176.67]  in
[176.67-177.03]  tears
[177.03-177.53]  when
[177.53-177.65]  they

[161.06-161.36]  family
[161.36-161.60]  and
[161.60-162.04]  friends
[162.04-162.48]  were
[162.48-162.92]  frozen
[162.92-163.16]  in
[163.16-163.50]  place.
[164.26-164.38]  Was
[164.38-164.56]  this
[164.56-164.68]  a
[164.68-164.88]  scary
[164.88-165.18]  time
[165.18-165.36]  for
[165.36-165.52]  you?
[166.02-166.40]  Definitely.
[166.96-167.24]  For
[167.24-167.70]  us
[167.70-168.12]  living
[168.12-168.38]  in
[168.38-168.74]  Mynot,
[168.90-169.00]  what
[169.00-169.18]  we
[169.18-169.38]  think
[169.38-169.56]  is
[169.56-169.68]  a
[169.68-169.94]  safe
[169.94-170.48]  community
[170.48-171.16]  and
[171.16-171.60]  who
[171.60-171.80]  really
[171.80-172.04]  cares
[172.04-172.26]  if
[172.26-172.36]  your
[172.36-172.60]  doors
[172.60-172.76]  are
[172.76-173.04]  locked
[173.04-173.20]  or
[173.20-173.42]  not.
[174.57-174.77]  From
[174.77-175.01]  that
[175.01-175.23]  day
[175.23-175.43]  on,
[175.59-175.65]  the
[175.65-175.87]  doors
[175.87-176.15]  were
[176.15-176.57]  definitely
[176.57-177.05]  locked.
[177.35-177.41]  When
[177.41-177.63]  it
[177.63-177.73]  got
[177.73-177.89]  to
[177.89-177.99]  be
[177.99-178.29]  dark,
[178.75-178.81]  the
[178.81-179.09]  shades
[179.09-179.29]  were
[179.29-179.57]  pulled.
[179.93-180.07]  I
[180.07-180.29]  felt
[180.29-180.63]  like
[180.63-181.19]  for
[181.19-181.31]  a
[181.31-181.53]  long
[181.53-181.95]  time,
[182.13-182.21]  and
[182.21-182.29]  I
[182.29-182.47]  still
[182.47-182.73]  am,
[182.85-182.91]  I'm
[182.91-183.25]  very
[183.25-183.73]  hyper
[183.73-184.11]  aware
[184.11-184.93]  of
[184.93-185.31]  where
[185.31-185.51]  I'm
[185.51-185.79]  at,
[186.01-186.13]  who's
[186.13-186.53]  around.
[186.97-187.19]  People
[187.19-187.41]  were
[187.41-187.83]  worried.
[188.29-188.31]  I
[188.31-188.45]  mean,
[188.67-189.09]  it's
[189.09-189.21]  just
[189.21-189.57]  that's
[189.57-189.57]  the
[189.57-189.71]  way
[189.71-189.83]  it
[189.83-190.05]  was.
[191.93-192.23]  Meanwhile,
[192.65-193.15]  investigators
[193.15-193.71]  began
[193.71-194.17]  piecing
[194.17-194.49]  together
[194.49-194.79]  a
[194.79-195.09]  picture
[195.09-195.53]  of
[195.53-195.79]  what
[195.79-196.35]  happened
[196.35-196.57]  in
[196.57-197.01]  Anita's
[197.01-197.27]  final
[197.27-197.81]  moments.
[198.35-198.81]  Looking
[198.81-199.05]  through
[199.05-199.17]  her
[199.17-199.51]  phone,
[199.63-200.07]  you
[200.07-200.27]  saw

[201.59-201.79]  caught
[201.79-201.97]  your
[201.97-202.23]  eye.
[202.43-202.53]  Yeah,
[202.55-202.79]  she

[4.94-5.04]  a

[6.72-7.32]  rarely

[8.28-8.54]  We

[9.22-9.62]  back
[9.62-9.76]  and

[18.02-18.08]  And
[18.08-18.38]  we

[24.16-24.28]  So

[168.28-168.54]  Two
[168.54-168.80]  days
[168.80-169.18]  after
[169.18-169.68]  Anita's
[169.68-169.94]  murder,
[170.42-170.48]  the
[170.48-170.82]  medical
[170.82-171.48]  examiner
[171.48-172.00]  released
[172.00-172.24]  the
[172.24-172.80]  autopsy
[172.80-173.18]  report.
[174.04-174.16]  Was
[174.16-174.28]  there
[174.28-174.42]  any
[174.42-174.68]  sexual
[174.68-175.00]  assault?
[175.54-175.66]  There
[175.66-175.80]  was
[175.80-176.16]  nothing
[176.16-176.46]  that
[176.46-176.64]  we
[176.64-176.86]  could
[176.86-177.24]  see
[177.24-177.56]  that
[177.56-177.70]  would
[177.70-178.16]  indicate
[178.16-178.66]  that
[178.66-178.86]  she
[178.86-179.04]  was
[179.04-179.38]  sexually
[179.38-179.86]  assaulted.
[180.22-180.32]  It
[180.32-180.44]  was
[180.44-180.90]  definitely
[180.90-181.64]  something
[181.64-182.08]  that
[182.08-182.28]  we
[182.28-182.60]  were
[182.60-183.30]  concerned
[183.30-183.74]  about
[183.74-184.04]  and
[184.04-184.12]  it
[184.12-184.26]  was
[184.26-184.40]  on
[184.40-184.54]  our
[184.54-184.94]  minds.
[185.34-185.66]  But
[185.66-185.84]  the
[185.84-186.50]  autopsy
[186.50-186.90]  did
[186.90-187.38]  reveal
[187.38-187.98]  something
[187.98-188.48]  that
[188.48-188.94]  piqued
[188.94-189.12]  their
[189.12-189.68]  interest.
[190.14-190.32]  We
[190.32-190.94]  found
[190.94-191.10]  out
[191.10-191.28]  that
[191.28-191.46]  there
[191.46-191.64]  was
[191.64-192.14]  superficial
[192.14-193.38]  cuts
[193.38-193.80]  or
[193.80-194.22]  marks
[194.22-194.76]  on
[194.76-195.32]  Anita's
[195.32-195.54]  neck.
[196.06-196.54]  So
[196.54-197.54]  it
[197.54-197.74]  led
[197.74-197.96]  us
[197.96-198.08]  to
[198.08-198.34]  believe
[198.34-198.62]  that
[198.62-199.00]  somebody
[199.00-199.24]  is
[199.24-199.54]  there
[199.54-199.90]  kind
[199.90-200.04]  of
[200.04-200.18]  in
[200.18-200.34]  her
[200.34-200.78]  face
[200.78-201.56]  holding
[201.56-201.82]  the
[201.82-202.08]  knife
[202.08-202.32]  to
[202.32-202.44]  her
[202.44-202.72]  neck
[202.72-203.58]  and
[203.58-203.84]  then
[203.84-205.46]  angry
[205.46-206.18]  and
[206.18-206.32]  then
[206.32-206.56]  that
[206.56-206.80]  just
[206.80-207.44]  escalated
[207.44-207.60]  to
[207.60-207.68]  the
[207.68-207.98]  point
[207.98-208.42]  of
[208.42-209.40]  stabbing
[209.40-209.62]  her.
[210.08-210.38]  When
[210.38-211.10]  you
[211.10-211.24]  think
[211.24-211.42]  about
[211.42-211.62]  those
[211.62-212.16]  details,
[212.36-212.52]  does
[212.52-212.64]  that
[212.64-213.00]  sound
[213.00-213.46]  like?
[214.23-214.79]  Possibly
[214.79-215.05]  someone
[215.05-215.31]  she
[215.31-215.65]  knew,
[216.15-216.41]  complete
[216.41-216.99]  stranger.
[217.55-217.97]  We
[217.97-218.21]  felt
[218.21-218.45]  like
[218.45-218.59]  it
[218.59-218.71]  was
[218.71-218.97]  somebody
[218.97-219.25]  that
[219.25-219.45]  she
[219.45-219.73]  knew.
[220.51-220.79]  And
[220.79-220.95]  as
[220.95-221.33]  Minot
[221.33-221.71]  police
[221.71-222.43]  continued
[222.43-223.01]  talking
[223.01-223.27]  to
[223.27-223.51]  those
[223.51-223.87]  close
[223.87-224.13]  to
[224.13-224.35]  Anita,
[225.01-225.17]  they
[225.17-225.43]  got
[225.43-225.73]  a
[225.73-226.29]  promising
[226.29-226.87]  tip.
[227.33-227.51]  We
[227.51-227.73]  did
[227.73-227.95]  have
[227.95-228.23]  one
[228.23-228.71]  witness
[228.71-229.41]  come
[229.41-229.81]  forward
[229.81-230.09]  and
[230.09-230.31]  say
[230.31-230.57]  that
[230.57-230.93]  she
[230.93-231.45]  saw
[231.45-231.89]  somebody
[231.89-232.37]  running
[232.37-232.93]  early
[232.93-233.21]  that
[233.21-233.61]  morning.
[234.23-234.43]  It
[234.43-234.63]  was
[234.63-234.75]  a
[234.75-235.07]  man
[235.07-235.97]  running
[235.97-236.49]  near
[236.49-237.03]  Anita's
[237.03-237.47]  apartment.
[238.21-238.37]  He
[238.37-238.75]  appeared
[238.75-238.95]  to
[238.95-239.11]  be
[239.11-239.27]  in
[239.27-239.45]  his
[239.45-239.81]  late
[239.81-240.01]  teens.

--- Chunk 7 ---
[0.00-0.46]  or
[0.46-0.80]  early
[0.80-1.46]  20s,
[1.78-1.92]  about
[1.92-2.20]  six
[2.20-2.54]  to
[2.54-3.06]  200
[3.06-3.60]  pounds
[3.60-4.16]  with
[4.16-4.48]  dark
[4.48-4.98]  hair.
[5.30-5.70]  And
[5.70-5.86]  there
[5.86-6.00]  was
[6.00-6.38]  something
[6.38-6.82]  more.
[7.34-7.42]  The
[7.42-7.64]  witness
[7.64-8.02]  said
[8.02-8.24]  there
[8.24-8.46]  was
[8.46-8.64]  a
[8.64-9.02]  stain
[9.02-9.28]  on
[9.28-9.44]  his
[9.44-9.90]  shirt,
[10.36-10.86]  possibly
[10.86-11.30]  blood.
[12.62-12.76]  It
[12.76-12.94]  was
[12.94-13.10]  their
[13.10-13.42]  first
[13.42-13.78]  big
[13.78-14.20]  lead.
[14.74-15.04]  Now
[15.04-15.30]  they
[15.30-15.58]  needed
[15.58-15.82]  to
[15.82-16.26]  find
[16.26-16.54]  the
[16.54-16.78]  running
[16.78-17.16]  man.
[17.64-17.82]  Maybe
[17.82-18.00]  it's
[18.00-18.16]  running
[18.16-18.46]  away
[18.46-18.64]  from
[18.64-18.76]  a
[18.76-18.90]  crime
[18.90-19.14]  scene.
[19.26-19.52]  That's
[19.52-19.68]  what
[19.68-19.88]  she
[19.88-20.14]  thought
[20.14-20.32]  it
[20.32-20.50]  could
[20.50-20.78]  be.
[34.35-34.83]  About
[34.83-35.17]  two
[35.17-35.45]  days
[35.45-35.83]  after
[35.83-36.17]  Anita
[36.17-36.83]  Knudsen's
[36.83-37.13]  murder,
[37.61-37.91]  police
[37.91-38.29]  were
[38.29-38.71]  chasing
[38.71-39.11]  a
[39.11-39.37]  new
[39.37-39.79]  tip.
[40.63-40.77]  A
[40.77-40.97]  woman
[40.97-41.25]  said
[41.25-41.43]  she
[41.43-41.65]  saw
[41.65-41.85]  a
[41.85-42.17]  young,
[42.41-42.61]  dark
[42.61-42.93] -haired
[42.93-43.23]  man
[43.23-43.83]  running
[43.83-44.21]  right
[44.21-44.47]  near
[44.47-44.91]  Anita's
[44.91-45.35]  apartment
[45.35-46.07]  around
[46.07-46.31]  the
[46.31-46.55]  time
[46.55-46.69]  of
[46.69-46.79]  the
[46.79-47.13]  murder.
[48.27-48.53]  And
[48.53-48.67]  he
[48.67-49.03]  looked
[49.03-49.47]  like
[49.47-49.63]  he
[49.63-49.81]  was
[49.81-49.95]  in
[49.95-50.07]  a
[50.07-50.37]  big
[50.37-50.87]  hurry.
[52.15-52.31]  So
[52.31-52.51]  she's
[52.51-52.67]  thinking
[52.67-52.95]  maybe
[52.95-53.23]  it's
[53.23-53.47]  not
[53.47-54.59]  running
[54.59-54.83]  out
[54.83-54.91]  for
[54.91-55.29]  exercise,
[55.53-55.67]  maybe
[55.67-55.85]  it's
[55.85-56.03]  running
[56.03-56.33]  away
[56.33-56.51]  from
[56.51-56.65]  a
[56.65-56.75]  crime
[56.75-57.03]  scene.
[57.13-57.69]  That's
[57.69-57.83]  what
[57.83-58.05]  she
[58.05-58.31]  thought
[58.31-58.49]  it
[58.49-58.67]  could
[58.67-58.99]  be.
[59.83-60.19]  Might
[60.19-60.33]  Not
[60.33-60.69]  Police
[60.69-61.23]  released
[61.23-61.61]  the
[61.61-61.93]  Running
[61.93-62.23]  Man
[62.23-62.67]  description
[62.67-63.03]  to
[63.03-63.15]  the
[63.15-63.53]  media
[63.84-64.18]  And
[64.18-64.32]  it
[64.32-64.56]  did
[64.56-65.04]  generate
[65.04-65.30]  some
[65.30-65.66]  tips,
[66.16-66.50]  but
[66.50-66.82]  none
[66.82-66.96]  of
[66.96-67.16]  them
[67.16-67.48]  went
[67.48-68.10]  anywhere.
[70.24-71.00]  Back
[71.00-71.20]  in
[71.20-71.70]  Anita's
[71.70-71.98]  hometown
[71.98-72.36]  of
[72.36-72.76]  Butte,
[73.06-73.16]  her
[73.16-73.58]  presence
[73.58-74.30]  was
[74.30-75.04]  everywhere.
[76.28-76.90]  And
[76.90-77.06]  on
[77.06-77.32]  one
[77.32-77.76]  particular
[77.76-78.28]  day,
[78.68-78.78]  her
[78.78-79.14]  friends
[79.14-79.58]  honored
[79.58-79.88]  her
[79.88-80.18]  with
[80.18-80.34]  a
[80.34-80.82]  brilliant
[80.82-81.22]  burst
[81.22-81.46]  of
[81.46-81.90]  light
[81.90-82.62]  in
[82.62-83.02]  true
[83.02-83.46]  Anita
[83.46-84.06]  style.
[84.84-85.08]  There
[85.08-85.22]  was
[85.22-85.32]  an
[85.32-85.78]  outpouring
[85.78-85.96]  of
[85.96-86.24]  love
[86.24-86.96]  in
[86.96-87.40]  Butte
[87.40-88.12]  after
[88.12-88.36]  Anita
[88.36-88.74]  died.
[89.70-90.18]  Leading
[90.18-90.38]  up
[90.38-90.50]  to
[90.50-90.62]  the
[90.62-90.92]  funeral
[90.92-91.52]  a

[91.64-91.76]  of
[91.76-91.92]  us
[91.92-92.18]  girls
[92.18-92.38]  had
[92.38-92.62]  gotten
[92.62-93.00]  together
[93.00-93.26]  and
[93.26-93.48]  we
[93.48-94.58]  made
[94.58-95.32]  bracelets
[95.32-96.36]  and
[96.36-97.16]  pins

[101.18-101.56]  pink
[101.56-102.14]  ribbons.
[102.34-102.60]  I
[102.60-102.68]  mean
[102.68-102.88]  that
[102.88-103.18]  it's
[103.18-103.32]  such
[103.32-103.38]  a
[103.38-103.62]  close
[103.62-103.78] -knit
[103.78-104.20]  community.
[104.36-104.60]  It's

[109.82-110.08]  up
[110.08-110.74]  You
[110.74-110.86]  could
[110.86-111.06]  drive
[111.06-111.34]  by
[111.34-111.52]  and
[111.52-111.60]  it
[111.60-111.80]  wouldn't
[111.80-112.04]  be
[112.04-112.48]  weird
[112.48-112.72]  to
[112.72-112.96]  see

[115.24-115.38]  of
[115.38-115.64]  thing
[116.41-116.93]  When
[116.93-117.39]  Anita's
[117.39-117.63]  friend
[117.63-118.07]  Lauren
[118.07-118.51]  arrived
[118.51-118.77]  from
[118.77-119.41]  California,
[119.81-120.05]  she
[120.05-120.27]  was
[120.27-120.59]  blown
[120.59-121.07]  away.
[122.37-122.97]  I
[122.97-123.19]  remember
[123.19-123.45]  the
[123.45-123.81]  entire
[123.81-124.25]  town
[124.25-124.71]  was
[124.71-126.57]  pink
[126.57-127.35]  every
[127.35-128.05]  storefront,
[128.49-129.33]  car,
[130.41-130.77]  light
[130.77-131.17]  post.
[131.49-131.75]  Everything
[131.75-132.21]  had
[132.21-132.41]  a
[132.41-132.71]  pink
[132.71-133.21]  bow
[133.21-133.51]  on
[133.51-133.75]  it.
[134.39-134.61]  We
[134.61-134.73]  will
[134.73-134.93]  miss
[134.93-135.09]  you,
[135.13-135.37]  Anita,
[135.67-135.83]  written
[135.83-136.05]  in
[136.05-136.21]  pink
[136.21-136.63]  marker.
[137.63-138.23]  Everywhere,
[138.43-138.61]  everywhere
[138.61-138.85]  you
[138.85-139.11]  drove,
[139.29-139.35]  there
[139.35-139.49]  was
[139.49-139.65]  just
[139.65-139.81]  pink
[139.81-140.27]  everywhere.
[140.63-140.79]  Were
[140.79-140.91]  you
[140.91-141.29]  surprised
[141.29-141.63]  to
[141.63-141.95]  see
[141.95-142.57]  the
[142.57-142.87]  whole
[142.87-143.33]  town
[143.33-143.93]  just
[143.93-144.23]  painted
[144.23-144.51]  pink
[144.51-144.79]  for
[144.79-144.97]  her?
[145.13-145.37]  Yeah.
[145.76-146.00]  I
[146.00-146.12]  was
[146.12-146.28]  from
[146.28-146.56]  Southern
[146.56-147.00]  California,
[147.00-147.28]  so
[147.28-147.82]  everybody
[147.82-148.16]  doesn't
[148.16-148.38]  know
[148.38-148.94]  everybody.
[149.14-149.34]  So
[149.34-150.16]  coming
[150.16-150.38]  out
[150.38-150.62]  here,
[150.80-151.80]  it's
[151.80-152.20]  definitely
[152.20-152.60]  a
[152.60-153.22]  smaller
[153.22-153.92]  town
[153.92-154.30]  and
[154.30-154.90]  everybody
[154.90-155.58]  was
[155.58-156.02]  affected
[156.02-156.44]  out
[156.44-156.76]  here
[156.76-157.32]  just
[157.32-157.56]  because
[157.56-158.28]  everybody
[158.28-158.84]  knows
[158.84-159.08]  each
[159.08-159.42]  other.
[159.92-160.08]  And
[160.08-160.24]  on
[160.24-160.38]  the
[160.38-160.58]  day
[160.58-160.68]  of
[160.68-160.80]  the
[160.80-161.18]  funeral,
[161.62-161.76]  the
[161.76-162.22]  entire
[162.22-163.00]  community
[163.00-163.58]  gathered
[163.58-163.90]  to
[163.90-164.12]  say
[164.12-164.50]  goodbye.
[165.04-165.20]  What
[165.20-165.44]  stands
[165.44-165.68]  out
[165.68-165.84]  to
[165.84-165.94]  you
[165.94-166.04]  the
[166.04-166.42]  most
[166.42-167.04]  about
[167.04-167.28]  her
[167.28-167.60]  funeral?
[167.95-168.13]  I
[168.13-168.27]  think
[168.27-168.41]  just
[168.41-168.55]  how
[168.55-168.71]  many
[168.71-169.07]  people
[169.07-169.33]  were
[169.33-169.55]  there
[169.55-169.85]  to
[169.85-170.35]  celebrate
[170.35-170.75]  my
[170.75-171.09]  sister.
[171.67-171.67]  I
[171.67-171.91]  mean,
[172.17-172.43]  she
[172.43-173.05]  truly
[173.05-173.27]  was
[173.27-173.67]  so
[173.67-174.01]  well
[174.01-174.47]  loved.
[174.73-174.73]  I
[174.73-174.93]  mean,
[174.99-175.19]  the
[175.19-175.39]  whole
[175.39-175.67]  church
[175.67-175.93]  was
[175.93-176.21]  full.
[176.39-176.45]  They
[176.45-176.57]  ended
[176.57-176.73]  up
[176.73-176.91]  having
[176.91-177.13]  to
[177.13-177.69]  open
[177.69-177.85]  up
[177.85-177.99]  the
[177.99-178.21]  gym
[178.21-178.39]  at
[178.39-178.51]  the
[178.51-178.89]  school
[178.89-179.21]  for
[179.21-179.33]  all
[179.33-179.45]  of
[179.45-179.55]  the
[179.55-179.95]  overflow
[179.95-180.41]  people.
[180.85-181.23]  And
[181.23-181.37]  they
[181.37-181.67]  watched
[181.67-181.91]  it
[181.91-182.13]  like
[182.13-182.41]  on
[182.41-182.73]  a
[182.73-183.05]  stream.
[183.57-183.71]  Did
[183.71-183.83]  you
[183.83-184.01]  speak
[184.01-184.23]  that
[184.23-184.43]  day?
[184.77-184.85]  I
[184.85-185.09]  did,
[185.25-185.43]  yeah.
[185.69-185.85]  I
[185.85-186.41]  got
[186.41-186.57]  up
[186.57-186.75]  there
[186.75-186.91]  and
[186.91-187.11]  just
[187.11-187.39]  said
[187.39-187.57]  a
[187.57-187.71]  few
[187.71-188.03]  words
[188.03-188.35]  about
[188.35-188.53]  my
[188.53-188.87]  sister
[188.87-189.19]  and
[189.19-189.39]  just
[189.39-189.63]  talked
[189.63-189.87]  about
[189.87-190.27]  how
[190.27-190.81]  just
[190.81-191.85]  effervescent
[191.85-192.03]  she
[192.03-192.33]  was
[192.33-192.67]  and
[192.67-193.07]  beautiful
[193.07-193.53]  and
[193.53-193.91]  perfect
[193.91-194.27]  really.
[194.73-195.01]  I
[195.01-195.13]  think
[195.13-195.27]  I
[195.27-195.45]  wore
[195.45-195.63]  one
[195.63-195.73]  of
[195.73-196.07]  Anita's
[196.07-196.37]  dresses
[196.37-197.19]  to
[197.19-197.29]  her
[197.29-197.55]  funeral.
[197.77-197.83]  To
[197.83-197.91]  her
[197.91-198.17]  funeral?
[198.51-198.55]  Yeah.
[199.33-199.51]  Was
[199.51-199.63]  that
[199.63-199.71]  a
[199.71-199.81]  way
[199.81-199.97]  of
[199.97-200.13]  feeling
[200.13-200.43]  close
[200.43-200.61]  to
[200.61-200.73]  her?
[200.91-201.17]  Yeah,
[201.87-202.17]  yeah.
[203.03-203.47]  But
[203.47-203.67]  in
[203.67-203.79]  the
[203.79-204.11]  midst
[204.11-204.33]  of
[204.33-204.47]  the
[204.47-204.79]  grief,
[205.33-205.45]  there
[205.45-205.67]  were
[205.67-206.69]  suspicions,
[207.15-207.61]  rumors
[207.61-208.33]  about
[208.33-208.89]  who
[208.89-209.11]  could
[209.11-209.29]  be
[209.29-209.83]  involved
[209.83-210.03]  in
[210.03-210.45]  Anita's
[210.45-210.79]  murder.
[212.27-212.65]  At
[212.65-212.73]  the
[212.73-212.95]  time,
[213.01-213.07]  did
[213.07-213.19]  you
[213.19-213.53]  remember
[213.53-214.13]  any
[214.13-214.53]  whispers
[214.53-214.99]  about
[214.99-216.17]  who
[216.17-216.31]  it
[216.31-216.43]  could
[216.43-216.57]  have
[216.57-216.75]  been?
[217.23-217.45]  Yeah,
[217.49-217.55]  I
[217.55-217.69]  mean
[217.69-217.97]  tons
[217.97-218.19]  of
[218.19-218.51]  whispers
[218.51-218.87]  all
[218.87-219.01]  the
[219.01-219.47]  time.
[220.53-220.97]  That's,
[221.05-221.17]  you
[221.17-221.27]  know,
[221.51-221.75]  people
[221.75-222.43]  never
[222.43-222.69]  stop
[222.69-223.13]  whispering.
[224.25-224.43]  But
[224.43-224.61]  yeah,
[224.95-225.13]  constant,
[225.59-225.75]  you
[225.75-225.97]  know,

[227.53-227.69]  has
[227.69-227.99]  always
[227.99-228.35]  been,
[228.35-229.27]  never
[229.27-229.49]  not
[229.49-229.65]  been
[229.65-229.75]  in
[229.75-229.83]  the
[229.83-230.09]  mix.
[230.89-231.21]  Police
[231.21-231.59]  had
[231.59-231.97]  also
[231.97-232.31]  been
[232.31-232.59]  hearing
[232.59-233.07]  things
[233.07-233.37]  about
[233.37-233.95]  Anita's
[233.95-234.19]  roommate,
[234.43-234.75]  Nicole.
[235.29-235.51]  We
[235.51-235.71]  learned
[235.71-235.95]  that
[235.95-236.11]  they
[236.11-236.31]  had
[236.31-236.55]  kind
[236.55-236.77]  of
[236.77-236.97]  a
[236.97-237.69]  poor
[237.69-238.51]  relationship,
[239.11-239.49]  that
[239.49-239.69]  there
[239.69-239.85]  was

--- Chunk 8 ---
[0.00-0.30]  minor
[0.30-0.84]  fights
[0.84-1.12]  and
[1.12-1.30]  some
[1.30-1.60]  arguing
[1.60-1.98]  between
[1.98-2.22]  the
[2.22-2.40]  two
[2.40-2.56]  of
[2.56-2.74]  them.
[3.14-3.18]  They
[3.18-3.32]  had
[3.32-3.54]  roommate
[3.54-3.86]  drama.
[4.44-4.56]  They
[4.56-4.76]  did,
[4.90-5.08]  yes.
[6.08-6.36]  Police
[6.36-6.64]  were
[6.64-6.96]  there
[6.96-7.34]  at
[7.34-7.48]  the
[7.48-7.86]  funeral,
[8.34-8.62]  watching
[8.62-8.88]  from
[8.88-9.08]  their
[9.08-9.46]  car
[9.46-9.76]  as
[9.76-10.14]  mourners
[10.14-10.68]  arrived.
[11.38-11.52]  At
[11.52-11.60]  the
[11.60-11.84]  same
[11.84-12.20]  time,
[12.54-12.62]  they
[12.62-12.98]  asked
[12.98-13.26]  Nicole
[13.26-13.52]  to
[13.52-13.76]  come
[13.76-13.92]  in
[13.92-14.10]  for
[14.10-14.44]  another
[14.44-14.98]  interview
[14.98-15.26]  later
[15.26-15.52]  that
[15.52-15.88]  day,
[16.60-16.74]  a
[16.74-16.96]  move
[16.96-17.28]  that
[17.28-17.60]  may
[17.60-17.78]  not
[17.78-17.94]  have
[17.94-18.20]  sat
[18.20-18.48]  well
[18.48-18.72]  with
[18.72-18.86]  her
[18.86-19.20]  mother.
[19.92-20.34]  Anita's
[20.34-20.62]  friends
[20.62-21.04]  remember
[21.04-21.46]  a
[21.46-21.88]  painful
[21.88-22.56]  exchange
[22.56-23.10]  between
[23.10-23.84]  Anita's
[23.84-24.08]  mom
[24.08-24.62]  and
[24.62-25.46]  Nicole's.
[26.48-26.76]  And
[26.76-26.88]  I
[26.88-27.46]  overheard
[27.46-28.42]  Nicole's
[28.42-28.74]  mom
[29.96-30.44]  asking
[30.44-30.76]  her
[30.76-31.10]  rather
[31.10-31.76]  aggressively,
[32.14-32.14]  like,
[33.30-33.58]  how
[33.58-33.76]  could
[33.76-33.90]  you
[33.90-34.06]  think
[34.06-34.26]  my
[34.26-34.48]  daughter
[34.48-34.74]  did
[34.74-35.26]  this?
[36.36-36.84]  I
[36.84-37.12]  can't
[37.12-37.40]  believe
[37.40-37.76]  that
[37.76-38.00]  this
[38.00-38.12]  is
[38.12-38.24]  the
[38.24-38.42]  rumor
[38.42-38.62]  going
[38.62-39.00]  around.
[39.10-39.22]  I'm
[39.22-39.70]  paraphrasing,
[39.86-39.94]  of
[39.94-40.08]  course,
[40.20-40.26]  because
[40.26-40.42]  I
[40.42-40.62]  can't
[40.62-40.78]  remember
[40.78-41.00]  the
[41.00-41.22]  exact
[41.22-41.50]  words,
[41.82-41.82]  but
[41.82-42.58]  something
[42.58-42.86]  to
[42.86-43.04]  the
[43.04-43.42]  effect
[43.42-43.76]  of,
[43.94-44.34]  you
[44.34-44.46]  know,
[44.48-44.58]  I
[44.58-44.90]  can't
[44.90-45.10]  believe
[45.10-45.30]  that
[45.30-45.54]  people
[45.54-45.68]  are
[45.68-45.96]  blaming
[45.96-46.26]  my
[46.26-46.56]  daughter
[46.56-46.82]  for
[46.82-47.10]  this.
[47.42-47.58]  This
[47.58-47.70]  is
[47.70-47.86]  all
[47.86-48.20]  happening
[48.20-48.64]  at
[48.64-48.78]  the
[48.78-49.02]  funeral.
[49.66-49.98]  Yes,
[50.04-50.28]  before
[50.28-50.50]  the
[50.50-50.74]  actual
[50.74-51.08]  funeral
[51.08-51.46]  started,
[51.62-51.78]  yeah.
[52.44-52.82]  I,
[52.84-53.06]  like,
[53.16-53.34]  turned
[53.34-53.74]  around
[53.74-54.22]  and,
[54.30-54.50]  like,
[55.06-55.18]  it
[55.18-55.34]  was
[55.34-55.52]  just
[55.52-55.88]  wild.
[56.36-56.60]  It
[56.60-56.82]  was
[56.82-57.24]  just
[57.24-58.22]  wild
[58.22-58.54]  behavior
[58.54-58.82]  for
[58.82-58.94]  an
[58.94-59.14]  adult.
[60.20-60.38]  But
[60.38-60.52]  the
[60.52-60.80]  dust
[60.80-61.28]  settled
[61.28-61.78]  and
[61.78-61.90]  the
[61.90-62.28]  memorial
[62.28-62.76]  moved
[62.76-63.16]  on.
[64.38-64.64]  And
[64.64-64.78]  a
[64.78-65.00]  very
[65.00-65.38]  close
[65.38-65.84]  friend
[65.84-66.14]  took
[66.14-66.54]  over,
[67.00-67.28]  Tyler
[67.28-68.08]  Schmaltz,
[68.44-68.58]  the
[68.58-68.80]  young
[68.80-69.06]  man
[69.06-69.28]  on
[69.28-69.42]  the
[69.42-69.70]  scene
[69.70-69.96]  that
[69.96-70.22]  first
[70.22-70.62]  night.
[71.56-71.72]  He
[71.72-71.86]  was
[71.86-72.18]  now
[72.18-72.54]  in
[72.54-72.66]  the
[72.66-73.02]  middle
[73.02-73.30]  of
[73.30-73.78]  Anita's
[73.78-74.18]  goodbye.
[75.22-75.52]  We
[75.52-75.66]  made
[75.66-75.76]  a
[75.76-76.06]  slideshow
[76.06-76.20]  for
[76.20-76.30]  her
[76.30-76.56]  parents.
[77.00-77.16]  What
[77.16-77.30]  kind
[77.30-77.36]  of
[77.36-77.56]  pictures
[77.56-77.82]  did
[77.82-77.92]  you
[77.92-78.08]  want
[78.08-78.16]  to
[78.16-78.38]  pick
[78.38-78.58]  of
[78.58-78.80]  Anita?
[79.06-79.14]  The
[79.14-79.34]  prom
[79.34-79.54]  ones
[79.54-79.74]  where
[79.74-79.92]  she's
[79.92-80.18]  dancing,
[80.52-80.62]  where
[80.62-80.84]  she's
[80.84-80.94]  with
[80.94-81.20]  friends
[81.20-81.38]  and
[81.38-81.68]  family.
[82.16-82.68]  Just
[82.68-82.82]  her
[82.82-83.02]  living
[83.02-83.22]  her
[83.22-83.46]  life.
[84.75-85.25]  He
[85.25-85.55]  also
[85.55-85.85]  took
[85.85-85.95]  it
[85.95-86.15]  upon
[86.15-86.65]  himself
[86.65-86.95]  to
[86.95-87.29]  arrange
[87.29-87.65]  a
[87.65-87.95]  send
[87.95-88.21] -off
[88.21-88.57]  with
[88.57-88.83]  pink
[88.83-89.31]  balloons.
[92.23-92.93]  Through
[92.93-97.07]  it
[97.07-97.37]  all,
[97.57-97.77]  police
[97.77-98.27]  wondered
[98.27-98.55]  if
[98.55-98.69]  the
[98.69-99.03]  killer
[99.03-99.59]  was
[99.59-99.93]  among
[99.93-100.21]  the
[100.21-100.81]  mourners
[100.81-101.51]  and
[101.51-101.63]  they
[101.63-101.83]  had
[101.83-102.05]  some
[102.05-102.37]  very
[102.37-103.07]  particular
[103.07-103.61]  questions
[103.61-103.97]  for
[103.97-104.15]  that
[104.15-104.43]  close
[104.43-104.93]  friend,
[105.43-105.63]  Tyler
[105.63-106.43]  Schmaltz.
[107.01-107.23]  Three
[107.23-107.49]  days
[107.49-107.85]  after
[107.85-108.01]  the
[108.01-108.39]  funeral,
[108.85-109.09]  Tyler
[109.09-109.45]  found
[109.45-109.95]  himself
[109.95-110.43]  once
[110.43-110.91]  again
[110.91-111.65]  talking
[111.65-111.95]  with
[111.95-112.45]  police.
[119.60-120.06]  Did
[120.06-120.16]  you
[120.16-120.36]  have
[120.36-120.70]  anybody
[120.70-121.14]  that
[121.14-121.26]  you
[121.26-121.50]  thought
[121.50-122.04]  that
[122.04-122.16]  you
[122.16-122.56]  suspected
[122.56-122.82]  at
[122.82-122.88]  the
[122.88-123.16]  time
[123.16-123.80]  back
[123.80-124.08]  then
[124.08-124.46]  Tyler
[124.46-129.48]  Now
[129.48-129.76]  they
[129.76-129.94]  had
[129.94-130.08]  the
[130.08-130.62]  final
[130.62-131.24]  answer
[131.24-131.98]  or
[131.98-132.26]  did
[132.26-132.64]  they
[132.64-133.56]  Nothing
[133.56-133.96]  has
[133.96-134.20]  more
[134.20-134.64]  suspense
