[47.32-47.44]  more
[47.44-47.80]  gently,
[47.98-48.14]  but
[48.14-48.44]  I
[48.44-48.60]  just
[48.60-49.00]  remember
[49.00-49.72]  Anita's

[51.12-51.38]  kind

[53.14-53.42]  just
[53.42-53.70]  goes

[54.50-54.96]  like
[54.96-55.18]  who
[55.18-55.32]  could
[55.32-55.52]  do
[55.52-55.86]  this?
[56.56-56.96]  Tyler
[56.96-57.58]  Schmaltz
[57.58-57.82]  was
[57.82-58.26]  kind

[62.66-62.86]  him
[62.86-63.10]  pretty
[63.10-63.42]  quickly.
[63.80-63.98]  Yes.
[65.12-65.50]  Nicole
[65.50-66.02]  Rice's
[66.02-66.22]  name
[66.22-66.54]  came
[66.54-66.80]  up.
[67.22-67.44]  I
[67.44-68.06]  overheard
[68.06-68.64]  Nicole's
[68.64-68.88]  mom
[68.88-69.74]  asking,
[69.98-70.06]  how
[70.06-70.26]  could
[70.26-70.38]  you
[70.38-70.56]  think
[70.56-70.76]  my
[70.76-71.00]  daughter
[71.00-71.24]  did
[71.24-71.62]  this?
[73.48-73.96]  We
[73.96-74.44]  were
[74.44-74.92]  dispatched
[74.92-75.26]  to
[75.26-75.40]  a
[75.40-75.60]  call
[75.60-75.96]  of
[75.96-76.36]  someone
[76.36-76.80]  entering
[76.80-77.02]  an
[77.02-77.44]  apartment.
[77.98-78.18]  There
[78.18-78.38]  was
[78.38-78.62]  a
[78.62-79.10]  male.
[79.58-79.66]  He
[79.66-79.92]  had
[79.92-80.22]  a
[80.22-80.48]  knife.
[80.94-81.16]  There
[81.16-81.32]  was
[81.32-81.42]  a
[81.42-81.66]  chance
[81.66-81.90]  that
[81.90-82.00]  he
[82.00-82.32]  crawled
[82.32-82.38]  into
[82.38-82.50]  the
[82.50-82.76]  window
[82.76-82.96]  and
[82.96-83.12]  killed
[83.12-83.36]  this
[83.36-83.56]  girl.
[84.10-84.16]  You
[84.16-84.30]  know
[84.30-84.40]  I
[84.40-84.74]  can't
[84.74-84.86]  grow
[84.86-85.08]  up.
[85.62-86.10]  There
[86.10-86.32]  were
[86.32-86.74]  many
[86.74-87.36]  possible
[87.36-87.96]  suspects.
[89.76-90.24]  If
[90.24-90.44]  someone
[90.44-90.64]  told
[90.64-90.80]  us
[90.80-90.90]  you
[90.90-91.02]  were
[91.02-91.12]  at
[91.12-91.20]  a
[91.20-91.52]  party
[91.52-91.98]  and
[91.98-92.06]  you
[92.06-92.20]  said
[92.20-92.38]  you
[92.38-92.62]  killed
[92.62-92.78]  her
[92.78-92.94]  here,
[93.22-93.46]  you'd
[93.46-93.56]  be
[93.56-93.82]  lying.
[95.04-95.52]  We've
[95.52-95.64]  been
[95.64-96.04]  reliving
[96.04-96.24]  this
[96.24-96.82]  every
[96.82-97.06]  single
[97.06-97.34]  day
[97.34-97.66]  for
[97.66-97.92]  18
[97.92-98.38]  years.
[99.07-99.49]  It's
[99.49-99.89]  really
[99.89-100.51]  scary
[100.51-101.05]  not
[101.05-101.41]  knowing
[101.41-101.57]  how
[101.57-101.79]  that's
[101.79-101.85]  going
[101.85-101.97]  to
[101.97-102.13]  turn
[102.13-102.33]  out.

[104.57-105.07]  a
[105.07-105.35]  case
[105.35-105.65]  that
[105.65-105.99]  dragged
[105.99-106.29]  on
[106.29-106.57]  for
[106.57-107.07]  years.
[107.61-107.75]  Good
[107.75-108.45]  revelations

[108.81-108.97]  a
[108.97-109.45]  party
[109.45-110.01]  finally
[110.01-110.49]  solved
[110.49-110.69]  the
[110.69-111.09]  mystery.
[111.93-112.09]  I'm

[135.56-135.94]  The

[137.40-137.84]  quiet

[158.04-158.32]  has
[158.32-158.58]  been

[159.82-160.10]  Of
[160.10-160.24]  a
[160.24-160.72]  mystery
[160.72-161.02]  that
[161.02-161.54]  spanned
[161.54-162.16]  nearly
[162.16-162.70]  two

[6.22-6.68]  Lear,
[7.00-7.14]  lived

[8.22-8.40]  How
[8.40-8.72]  excited
[8.72-8.96]  was
[8.96-9.14]  she
[9.14-9.42]  for
[9.42-9.72]  college?
[10.12-10.34]  Very
[10.34-10.58]  much
[10.58-10.78]  so.
[11.44-11.44]  And
[11.44-12.08]  she
[12.08-12.28]  also
[12.28-12.70]  worked

[13.20-13.40]  jobs

[15.04-15.14]  of
[15.14-15.24]  the
[15.24-15.52]  weekends,
[15.76-15.82]  she
[15.82-15.96]  would
[15.96-16.08]  go
[16.08-16.24]  back
[16.24-16.44]  to
[16.44-16.62]  But
[16.62-17.14]  and

[17.52-17.76]  mom
[17.76-17.98]  in
[17.98-18.12]  the
[18.12-18.38]  store.
[18.74-18.98]  She
[18.98-19.06]  and
[19.06-19.10]  my
[19.10-19.30]  mom
[19.30-19.56]  talked

[20.14-20.36]  single
[20.36-20.54]  day
[20.54-20.66]  on
[20.66-20.76]  the
[20.76-21.12]  phone.
[21.56-21.70]  Even
[21.70-21.86]  when
[21.86-21.96]  she
[21.96-22.08]  went
[22.08-22.18]  to
[22.18-22.44]  college.
[22.72-22.82]  Yeah,
[22.94-23.08]  even
[23.08-23.16]  when
[23.16-23.26]  she
[23.26-23.32]  went
[23.32-23.42]  to
[23.42-23.70]  college,
[23.70-23.98]  she
[23.98-24.10]  was

[24.36-24.94]  calling
[24.94-25.18]  my
[25.18-25.56]  mom.
[25.72-25.86]  She
[25.86-25.92]  was
[25.92-26.08]  such
[26.08-26.12]  a
[26.12-26.26]  hard
[26.26-26.58]  worker,
[26.76-26.84]  but
[26.84-26.96]  she
[26.96-27.12]  still
[27.12-27.22]  made
[27.22-27.52]  time
[27.52-27.70]  for
[27.70-27.78]  her
[27.78-27.98]  friend
[27.98-28.18]  and
[28.18-28.34]  for
[28.34-28.42]  her
[28.42-28.74]  family.
[29.15-29.39]  So
[29.39-29.61]  when
[29.61-30.05]  Anita's
[30.05-30.41]  family
[30.41-30.79]  didn't
[30.79-31.01]  hear
[31.01-31.25]  from
[31.25-31.47]  her
[31.47-31.91]  one
[31.91-32.35]  weekend
[32.35-32.65]  in
[32.65-32.85]  June
[32.85-33.71]  2007,
[34.11-34.55]  they
[34.55-34.91]  figured
[34.91-35.37]  she
[35.37-35.53]  was
[35.53-35.67]  at
[35.67-36.01]  work,
[36.55-36.89]  at
[36.89-37.21]  least
[37.21-37.95]  at
[37.95-38.59]  first.
[40.31-40.61]  Saturday
[40.61-41.07]  passed,
[41.87-42.45]  then
[42.45-43.31]  Sunday.
[44.13-44.31]  Was
[44.31-44.53]  it
[44.53-45.13]  out
[45.13-45.29]  of
[45.29-45.73]  character
[45.73-46.21]  for
[46.21-46.37]  them
[46.37-46.55]  to
[46.55-46.75]  not
[46.75-47.05]  hear
[47.05-47.37]  from
[47.37-47.59]  Anita?
[47.69-47.87]  Very
[47.87-48.15]  much
[48.15-48.37]  so,
[48.67-49.15]  absolutely.
[49.91-50.25]  By
[50.25-50.69]  Monday,
[51.07-51.21]  with
[51.21-51.43]  no
[51.43-51.81]  word
[51.81-52.07]  from
[52.07-52.41]  Anita,
[53.01-53.11]  her
[53.11-53.35]  dad
[53.35-53.79]  Gordon
[53.79-54.15]  made
[54.15-54.35]  the
[54.35-54.71]  hour
[54.71-55.01] -long
[55.01-55.39]  drive
[55.39-55.67]  to
[55.67-55.85]  his
[55.85-56.23]  daughter's
[56.23-56.65]  apartment
[56.65-57.05]  to
[57.05-57.25]  check
[57.25-57.53]  on
[57.53-57.77]  her.
[58.19-58.57]  When
[58.57-58.73]  he
[58.73-59.01]  peered
[59.01-59.27]  through
[59.27-59.69]  Anita's
[59.69-60.03]  window,
[60.39-60.47]  he
[60.47-60.65]  saw
[60.65-60.85]  her
[60.85-61.27]  lying
[61.27-61.67]  face
[61.67-62.11]  down
[62.11-62.53]  in
[62.53-62.73]  her
[62.73-63.07]  bed.
[63.71-63.89]  The
[63.89-64.27]  apartment
[64.27-64.79]  manager
[64.79-65.01]  let
[65.01-65.23]  him
[65.23-65.75]  inside
[65.75-66.29]  and
[66.29-66.77]  immediately
[66.77-67.43]  called
[67.43-68.15]  911.
[88.71-89.23]  That's
[89.23-89.31]  what
[89.31-89.49]  her
[89.49-89.91]  father
[89.91-90.25]  said.
[90.63-90.85]  I
[90.85-91.17]  didn't
[91.17-91.59]  touch
[91.59-91.73]  her,
[91.81-91.87]  but
[91.87-91.97]  I
[91.97-92.17]  see
[92.17-92.47]  there's
[92.47-92.61]  blood
[92.61-92.81]  on
[92.81-92.91]  the
[92.91-93.15]  blanket.
[93.79-94.17]  Right
[94.17-94.51]  away
[94.51-95.31]  Anita's
[95.31-95.57]  dad
[95.57-95.99]  called
[95.99-96.29]  his
[96.29-96.75]  sister
[96.75-97.27]  Karen.
[98.03-98.23]  He
[98.23-98.49]  said,
[98.89-99.23]  you've
[99.23-99.39]  got
[99.39-99.51]  to
[99.51-99.71]  come
[99.71-99.91]  here.
[101.89-102.41]  He
[102.41-104.99]  must
[104.99-105.17]  have
[105.17-105.33]  said
[105.33-105.73]  she's
[105.73-105.91]  dead.
[106.81-107.13]  When
[107.13-107.33]  she
[107.33-107.73]  arrived
[107.73-108.21]  police
[108.21-108.53]  were
[108.53-109.11]  already
[109.11-109.41]  on
[109.41-109.53]  the
[109.53-109.91]  scene.
[110.49-110.61]  So
[110.61-110.73]  you
[110.73-110.97]  drive
[110.97-111.19]  up
[111.19-111.31]  to
[111.31-111.43]  the
[111.43-111.89]  apartment
[111.89-112.57]  and
[112.57-112.69]  the
[112.69-112.91]  only
[112.91-113.05]  thing
[113.05-113.17]  that
[113.17-113.29]  you
[113.29-113.53]  know
[113.53-114.19]  is
[114.19-114.51]  that
[114.51-114.83]  she's
[114.83-115.01]  gone.
[115.39-115.79]  Anita's
[115.79-116.03]  gone.
[116.25-116.41]  Right.
[116.83-117.05]  I
[117.05-117.57]  can't
[117.57-118.11]  imagine
[118.11-118.65]  Karen,
[119.31-119.73]  him
[119.73-120.11]  coming
[120.11-120.41]  to
[120.41-120.63]  check
[120.63-120.87]  on
[120.87-121.19]  Anita
[121.19-122.47]  and
[122.47-122.69]  being
[122.69-122.95]  the
[122.95-123.15]  one
[123.15-123.39]  to
[123.39-123.89]  discover
[123.89-124.35]  that
[124.35-124.57]  she
[124.57-124.71]  had
[124.71-124.85]  been
[124.85-125.13]  killed.
[126.01-126.57]  When
[126.57-126.75]  you
[126.75-126.97]  got
[126.97-127.25]  there
[127.25-127.41]  and
[127.41-127.63]  saw
[127.63-127.95]  him,
[128.57-128.87]  how
[128.87-129.05]  was
[129.05-129.27]  he?
[129.89-130.15]  Oh,
[130.61-130.95]  in
[130.95-131.27]  shock.
[131.81-131.89]  I
[131.89-132.03]  mean,
[132.25-132.51]  it's
[132.51-132.93]  just
[132.93-133.75]  something
[133.75-133.95]  you
[133.95-134.23]  never,
[134.39-134.61]  ever
[134.61-134.99]  can
[134.99-135.37]  prepare
[135.37-135.85]  yourself
[135.85-136.15]  for.
[137.23-137.79]  Karen
[137.79-138.11]  stayed
[138.11-138.33]  on
[138.33-138.45]  the
[138.45-138.73]  scene

[144.07-144.81]  he's...
[144.78-145.28]  waiting

[149.48-149.66]  he
[149.66-149.86]  knows
[149.86-150.06]  he

[154.84-155.16]  So
[155.16-155.64]  he
[155.64-155.92]  stayed
[155.92-156.18]  for
[156.18-156.34]  a
[156.34-156.70]  while,
[157.12-157.32]  but
[157.32-157.50]  then
[157.50-157.64]  he
[157.64-157.86]  knew
[157.86-158.12]  he
[158.12-158.48]  had
[158.48-158.62]  to

[161.46-161.54]  he
[161.54-161.76]  stayed.
[162.34-162.42]  I
[162.42-163.10]  wouldn't
[163.10-163.32]  leave.
[165.00-165.48]  What
[165.48-165.64]  made
[165.64-165.82]  you
[165.82-166.04]  stay?
[167.22-167.70]  Couldn't
[167.70-168.00]  leave.
[169.30-169.78]  We
[169.78-169.98]  had
[169.98-170.14]  to

[170.40-170.58]  there
[170.58-170.82]  for
[170.82-171.02]  her.
[173.26-173.72]  You

[176.16-176.64]  It
[176.64-176.72]  had
[176.72-176.90]  to
[176.90-177.02]  be
[177.02-177.22]  there.
[178.50-178.98]  She
[178.98-179.24]  knew
[179.24-179.46]  when
[179.46-179.72]  that
[179.72-180.16]  instant,
[180.82-181.26]  everything
[181.26-181.58]  had
[181.58-182.34]  changed.
[182.72-182.92]  From

[185.16-185.34]  doors
[185.34-185.60]  were
[185.60-186.06]  definitely
[186.06-186.48]  locked,
[186.64-186.72]  the
[186.72-186.94]  shades
[186.94-187.18]  were
[187.18-187.46]  pulled.
[188.04-188.22]  And
[188.22-188.36]  the
[188.36-188.84]  mystery
[188.84-189.12]  of
[189.12-189.34]  who
[189.34-189.68]  killed
[189.68-189.96]  Anita
[189.96-190.80]  was
[190.80-191.36]  only
[191.36-191.70]  just

[195.88-196.18]  to
[196.18-196.30]  her
[196.30-196.54]  neck.
[196.82-196.92]  It
[196.92-197.08]  was
[197.08-197.36]  scary,
[197.36-197.62]  I
[197.62-197.72]  mean,
[197.90-198.00]  because
[198.00-198.60]  anybody

--- Chunk 2 ---
[0.00-0.76]  unexplained

[2.00-2.26]  young
[2.26-2.68]  college
[2.68-3.16]  student

[7.68-8.12]  So
[8.12-8.26]  as
[8.26-8.38]  you're
[8.38-8.50]  on
[8.50-8.64]  your
[8.64-8.76]  way
[8.76-8.98]  there,
[9.38-9.56]  what
[9.56-9.66]  are
[9.66-9.76]  you
[9.76-10.06]  thinking?
[10.62-10.78]  I
[10.78-10.98]  was
[10.98-11.18]  new
[11.18-11.46]  to
[11.46-12.20]  investigations,
[12.56-12.70]  kind
[12.70-12.82]  of
[12.82-13.00]  wondered
[13.00-13.26]  what
[13.26-13.66]  direction
[13.66-13.96]  we'd
[13.96-14.10]  go
[14.10-14.40]  in,
[14.56-14.56]  and
[14.56-14.84]  are
[14.84-14.98]  we
[14.98-15.08]  going
[15.08-15.14]  to
[15.14-15.36]  solve
[15.36-15.62]  this
[15.62-15.82]  right
[15.82-16.10]  away?
[16.42-16.42]  Is
[16.42-16.50]  it
[16.50-16.58]  going
[16.58-16.66]  to
[16.66-16.76]  be
[16.76-17.20]  difficult?
[18.50-18.58]  On
[18.58-18.76]  that
[18.76-19.08]  early
[19.08-19.50]  evening
[19.50-19.70]  in
[19.70-20.10]  June,
[20.42-20.66]  Sergeant
[20.66-21.08]  Goodman
[21.08-21.38]  knew
[21.38-21.68]  very
[21.68-22.18]  little
[22.18-22.46]  when
[22.46-22.62]  he
[22.62-22.96]  arrived
[22.96-23.14]  at
[23.14-23.56]  Anita's
[23.56-24.02]  apartment.
[29.55-29.99]  So
[29.99-30.13]  when
[30.13-30.27]  you
[30.27-30.51]  got
[30.51-31.03]  here

[32.53-32.63]  did
[32.63-32.77]  you
[32.77-32.95]  see?
[33.91-34.15]  I
[34.15-34.35]  believe
[34.35-34.61]  they
[34.61-34.87]  had
[34.87-35.23]  police
[35.23-35.49]  tape
[35.49-35.73]  up
[35.73-36.19]  already.
[36.99-37.25]  The

[37.45-37.77]  scene
[37.77-37.97]  van

[38.95-39.23]  right
[39.23-39.41]  out
[39.41-39.55]  in
[39.55-39.67]  front
[39.67-39.81]  of
[39.81-39.89]  the

[41.03-41.11]  And
[41.11-41.99]  detectives
[41.99-42.13]  were
[42.13-42.43]  inside
[42.43-42.69]  the
[42.69-43.07]  apartment.
[43.39-43.53]  Is
[43.53-43.63]  that
[43.63-43.77]  the
[43.77-43.95]  front
[43.95-44.15]  door
[44.15-44.45]  right
[44.45-44.65]  there?
[44.77-44.77]  Yes,
[44.83-45.09]  that's
[45.09-45.21]  the
[45.21-45.45]  front
[45.45-45.65]  and
[45.65-45.89]  only
[45.89-46.21]  door
[46.21-46.65]  going

[47.21-47.57]  number
[47.57-47.93]  five.
[48.45-48.77]  The
[48.77-49.11]  bedroom
[49.11-49.63]  window
[49.63-49.97]  caught
[49.97-50.21]  his
[50.21-50.57]  eye.
[50.97-51.11]  What
[51.11-51.21]  did
[51.21-51.29]  you
[51.29-51.49]  notice
[51.49-51.87]  about
[51.87-52.25]  her
[52.25-52.59]  window?
[53.23-53.39]  I
[53.39-53.59]  noticed
[53.59-53.83]  that
[53.83-53.99]  the
[53.99-54.25]  screen
[54.25-54.51]  was
[54.51-54.83]  gone.
[55.55-56.03]  An
[56.03-56.51]  important
[56.51-57.11]  detail?
[57.60-58.04]  That
[58.04-58.56]  remained
[58.56-58.90]  to
[58.90-59.06]  be
[59.06-59.46]  seen.
[60.48-60.72]  As
[60.72-61.02]  police
[61.02-61.50]  began
[61.50-62.06]  processing
[62.06-62.32]  the
[62.32-62.58]  crime
[62.58-63.12]  scene,
[63.76-64.16]  Anita's
[64.16-64.52]  father,
[64.86-65.16]  Gordon,
[65.60-65.70]  had
[65.70-66.00]  begun
[66.00-66.22]  the
[66.22-66.48]  grim
[66.48-66.92]  duty
[66.92-67.34]  of
[67.34-67.64]  telling
[67.64-67.86]  his
[67.86-68.38]  family.
[69.32-69.78]  Anita's
[69.78-70.08]  15
[70.08-70.28] -year
[70.28-70.46] -old
[70.46-70.86]  sister,
[71.08-71.32]  Anna,
[71.72-71.84]  got
[71.84-72.02]  the
[72.02-72.22]  news
[72.22-72.44]  from
[72.44-72.64]  her
[72.64-73.00]  brother.
[73.72-74.10]  Daniel
[74.10-74.34]  comes
[74.34-74.56]  to
[74.56-74.70]  pick
[74.70-74.84]  me
[74.84-75.02]  up
[75.02-75.28]  and
[75.28-75.82]  I
[75.82-75.94]  get
[75.94-76.04]  in
[76.04-76.14]  the
[76.14-76.34]  car
[76.34-76.72]  and
[76.72-77.66]  I
[77.66-77.76]  could
[77.76-77.92]  tell
[77.92-78.16]  he'd
[78.16-78.26]  been
[78.26-78.66]  crying.
[79.24-79.42]  Like,
[79.68-80.10]  something
[80.10-80.28]  was
[80.28-80.56]  very
[80.56-80.94]  wrong.
[81.46-81.68]  And
[81.68-81.74]  I
[81.74-81.84]  was
[81.84-81.94]  like,
[81.96-82.06]  well,
[82.16-82.32]  what's

[82.50-82.94]  on?
[83.32-83.40]  And
[83.40-83.64]  he's
[83.64-83.74]  like,
[83.86-83.94]  and
[83.94-84.02]  I
[84.02-84.28]  can't
[84.28-84.44]  tell
[84.44-84.68]  you.
[85.86-86.42]  Finally,
[86.66-86.80]  he
[86.80-87.14]  spoke
[87.14-87.36]  the
[87.36-87.86]  words.
[89.06-89.62]  Anita
[89.62-90.56]  was
[90.56-90.98]  dead.
[91.70-92.02]  This
[92.02-92.28]  is,
[92.36-92.46]  of
[92.46-92.58]  course,
[92.58-92.86]  my
[92.86-93.14]  first
[93.14-93.38]  time
[93.38-94.06]  with
[94.06-94.30]  any
[94.30-94.56]  type
[94.56-94.78]  of
[94.78-94.98]  grief
[94.98-95.30]  at
[95.30-95.48]  this
[95.48-95.82]  level.
[96.30-96.42]  But
[96.42-96.50]  I
[96.50-96.86]  learned
[96.86-97.50]  about
[97.50-97.84]  myself
[97.84-98.08]  in
[98.08-98.22]  that
[98.22-98.54]  moment,
[98.82-98.90]  like,
[99.00-99.00]  I
[99.00-99.10]  don't
[99.10-99.38]  want
[99.38-99.68]  people
[99.68-100.14]  around.
[100.50-100.58]  I
[100.58-100.74]  don't
[100.74-101.16]  want
[101.16-101.80]  people
[101.80-102.10]  coming
[102.10-102.30]  in
[102.30-102.48]  to
[102.48-102.72]  ask
[102.72-102.94]  me
[102.94-103.54]  if
[103.54-103.72]  I'm
[103.72-103.96]  okay
[103.96-104.28]  every
[104.28-104.46]  five
[104.46-105.04]  seconds,
[105.04-105.48]  especially
[105.48-105.82]  people
[105.82-106.06]  that
[106.06-106.40]  don't
[106.40-106.54]  know
[106.54-106.88]  me.
[107.72-108.18]  Daniel
[108.18-108.64]  was
[108.64-109.12]  also
[109.12-109.50]  taking
[109.50-109.74]  it
[109.74-110.10]  hard.
[110.74-110.94]  I
[110.94-111.26]  understand
[111.26-111.46]  that
[111.46-111.78]  Daniel
[111.78-112.00]  and
[112.00-112.28]  Anita
[112.28-112.98]  had
[112.98-113.10]  a
[113.10-113.34]  very
[113.34-113.78]  special
[113.78-114.48]  relationship.
[114.72-114.82]  They
[114.82-114.96]  did.
[115.28-115.54]  Mm
[115.54-115.64] -hmm,
[116.00-116.12]  they
[116.12-116.22]  were
[116.22-116.46]  very
[116.46-116.80]  close.
[117.68-117.98]  Gordon
[117.98-118.16]  and
[118.16-118.34]  his
[118.34-118.56]  wife
[118.56-118.92]  Sharon
[118.92-119.50]  adopted
[119.50-119.84]  the
[119.84-120.04]  three
[120.04-120.42]  siblings
[120.42-120.90]  when
[120.90-121.06]  they
[121.06-121.20]  were
[121.20-121.46]  all
[121.46-121.82]  very
[121.82-122.30]  young.
[123.06-123.30]  They
[123.30-123.52]  spent
[123.52-123.70]  their
[123.70-124.02]  early
[124.02-124.54]  childhood
[124.54-124.96]  in
[124.96-125.34]  sunny
[125.34-125.82]  Southern
[125.82-126.54]  California.
[127.02-127.30]  It
[127.30-127.42]  was
[127.42-127.52]  a
[127.52-127.68]  fun
[127.68-127.88]  little
[127.88-128.20]  childhood,
[128.50-128.68]  yeah.
[129.32-129.84]  Lauren
[129.84-130.28]  Lessig
[130.28-130.50]  and
[130.50-130.76]  Anita
[130.76-131.44]  became
[131.44-132.06]  forever
[132.06-132.62]  friends
[132.62-133.14]  in
[133.14-133.58]  kindergarten.
[135.76-135.94]  What
[135.94-136.18]  was
[136.18-136.30]  it
[136.30-136.48]  about
[136.48-136.70]  Anita
[136.70-137.02]  that
[137.02-137.22]  just
[137.22-137.70]  really
[137.70-137.90]  drew
[137.90-138.10]  you
[138.10-138.26]  to
[138.26-138.44]  her?
[139.10-139.30]  She
[139.30-139.46]  was
[139.46-139.60]  just
[139.60-140.72]  positive
[140.72-140.94]  and
[140.94-141.26]  happy
[141.26-141.58]  and
[141.58-142.48]  just...
[142.60-143.06]  the
[143.06-143.38]  best.
[143.58-143.58]  I
[143.58-143.70]  mean,
[143.70-143.86]  she
[143.86-144.12]  always
[144.12-144.44]  did
[144.44-144.70]  what
[144.70-144.92]  was
[144.92-145.18]  right.
[145.58-145.92]  She
[145.92-146.64]  never,
[146.70-147.84]  like,
[147.98-148.28]  wavered
[148.28-148.36]  in
[148.36-148.60]  that.
[149.24-149.60]  Then,
[149.84-150.02]  when
[150.02-150.26]  Anita
[150.26-150.58]  was
[150.58-151.00]  almost
[151.00-151.62]  14,
[152.16-152.26]  Gordon
[152.26-152.74]  decided
[152.74-153.02]  to
[153.02-153.18]  move
[153.18-153.36]  the
[153.36-153.70]  family
[153.70-154.00]  up
[154.00-154.40]  north
[154.40-154.96]  to
[154.96-155.16]  his
[155.16-155.56]  hometown
[155.56-156.26]  of
[156.26-156.96]  Butte.
[157.50-157.60]  One
[157.60-157.88]  day,
[158.52-158.88]  your
[158.88-159.02]  dad
[159.02-159.28]  comes
[159.28-159.50]  in
[159.50-159.64]  and
[159.64-159.96]  says,
[160.44-160.86]  removing
[160.86-161.02]  a
[161.02-161.20]  North
[161.20-161.46]  Dakota.
[161.86-162.06]  Yeah,
[162.30-162.52]  Southern
[162.52-162.88]  California
[162.88-163.18]  is
[163.18-163.50]  such.
[163.58-163.82]  It's
[163.82-164.36]  obviously
[164.36-164.70]  very
[164.70-165.16]  different
[165.16-165.52]  than
[165.52-166.18]  North
[166.18-166.60]  Central
[166.60-166.74]  and
[166.74-166.86]  North
[166.86-167.20]  Dakota,
[167.28-167.56]  for
[167.56-167.84]  sure.
[168.20-168.42]  For
[168.42-168.68]  Anita,
[168.92-169.08]  I
[169.08-169.22]  think
[169.22-169.42]  it
[169.42-169.66]  was
[169.66-170.52]  really
[170.52-170.86]  hard.
[171.63-172.01]  friendship
[172.01-172.21]  was
[172.21-172.33]  so
[172.33-172.65]  important
[172.65-172.83]  to
[172.83-173.01]  her
[173.01-173.21]  and
[173.21-173.77]  leaving
[173.77-174.01]  all
[174.01-174.11]  of
[174.11-174.21]  her
[174.21-174.43]  friends
[174.43-174.79]  behind
[174.79-175.27]  and
[175.27-175.59]  I
[175.59-175.71]  mean
[175.71-175.89]  she
[175.89-176.01]  was
[176.01-176.11]  it
[176.11-176.21]  was
[176.21-176.29]  a
[176.29-176.49]  tough
[176.49-176.97]  age
[176.97-177.31]  to
[177.31-177.59]  I
[177.59-177.67]  mean
[177.67-177.83]  we
[177.83-177.99]  went
[177.99-178.15]  from
[178.15-178.43]  being
[178.43-178.79]  you
[178.79-178.93]  know
[178.93-179.33]  like
[179.33-180.11]  being
[180.11-180.25]  in
[180.25-180.29]  a
[180.29-180.61]  school
[180.61-181.03]  where
[181.03-181.67]  lots
[181.67-181.89]  of
[181.89-182.09]  kids
[182.09-182.25]  look
[182.25-182.41]  like
[182.41-182.77]  us
[182.77-183.09]  to
[183.09-183.77]  being
[183.77-183.89]  in
[183.89-183.97]  a
[183.97-184.23]  school
[184.23-184.57]  where
[184.57-185.07]  were
[185.07-185.19]  the
[185.19-185.37]  only
[185.37-185.73]  three
[185.73-186.21]  black
[186.21-186.35]  and
[186.35-186.51]  brown
[186.51-186.81]  kids
[186.81-187.13]  there
[187.13-187.75]  is
[187.75-188.25]  pretty
[188.25-189.65]  jarring
[189.65-189.99]  to
[189.99-190.13]  say
[190.13-190.29]  the
[190.29-190.65]  least
[190.65-191.19]  how
[191.19-191.29]  did
[191.29-191.45]  she
[191.45-191.77]  overcome
[191.77-192.07]  that
[192.07-192.55]  you
[192.55-192.69]  know
[192.69-192.85]  I
[192.85-193.01]  think
[193.01-193.27]  for
[193.27-193.59]  Anita
[193.59-194.17]  she
[194.17-196.05]  was
[196.05-196.35]  always
[196.35-196.65]  good
[196.65-196.91]  with
[196.91-197.41]  challenges
[197.41-197.79]  like
[197.79-198.07]  she
[198.07-198.49]  there's
[198.49-198.73]  really
[198.73-198.97]  nothing
[198.97-199.19]  that
[199.19-199.33]  she
[199.33-199.75]  couldn't
[199.75-200.69]  make
[200.69-200.89]  it
[200.89-201.17]  through
[201.48-201.68]  What
[201.68-201.80]  was
[201.80-201.90]  your
[201.90-202.14]  first
[202.14-202.62]  impression
[202.62-203.02]  of
[203.02-203.20]  Anita?
[203.92-204.12]  Just
[204.12-204.52]  like
[204.52-204.86]  teeny
[204.86-205.42]  tiny
[205.42-205.98]  little
[205.98-206.58]  ball
[206.58-206.88]  of
[206.88-207.22]  energy
[207.22-207.40]  and
[207.40-207.72]  sunshine.
[208.78-209.02]  Amber
[209.02-209.32]  Nix
[209.32-209.56]  met
[209.56-209.80]  Anita
[209.80-210.16]  when
[210.16-210.34]  they
[210.34-210.50]  were

[213.24-213.72]  age,
[214.00-214.06]  she
[214.06-214.26]  thought
[214.26-214.54]  Anita
[214.54-215.04]  was
[215.04-215.74]  perfectly
[215.74-216.02]  put
[216.02-216.60]  together.
[217.18-217.70]  Matching

[15.42-15.78] -do,
[16.12-16.52]  generous

[17.82-18.18]  She
[18.18-18.56]  literally
[18.56-18.92]  became
[18.92-19.22]  friends
[19.22-19.54]  with
[19.54-20.28]  anybody,
[20.54-20.64]  like
[20.64-20.92]  she
[20.92-21.50]  always,

[23.38-23.60]  the
[23.60-23.88]  people
[23.88-24.38]  that
[24.38-25.10]  probably
[25.10-25.34]  never
[25.34-25.58]  would
[25.58-25.76]  have
[25.76-25.92]  a
[25.92-26.06]  lot
[26.06-26.20]  of
[26.20-26.48]  friends,
[26.48-26.82]  so
[26.82-27.14]  she
[27.14-27.98]  always
[28.44-28.64]  you
[28.64-28.76]  know,
[28.84-28.94]  try
[28.94-29.04]  to
[29.04-29.12]  be
[29.12-29.32]  friends
[29.32-29.48]  with
[29.48-30.04]  everybody.
[30.92-31.26]  After
[31.26-31.52]  high
[31.52-31.80]  school,
[32.16-32.28]  it
[32.28-32.46]  was
[32.46-32.70]  on
[32.70-32.86]  to
[32.86-33.30]  college
[33.30-33.56]  and
[33.56-33.74]  my
[33.74-34.00]  not,
[34.44-34.64]  about
[34.64-34.86]  an
[34.86-35.22]  hour
[35.22-35.52]  from
[35.52-35.76]  but.
[36.60-36.84]  She
[36.84-37.00]  wanted
[37.00-37.14]  to
[37.14-37.22]  be
[37.22-37.32]  a
[37.32-37.60]  teacher
[37.60-38.06]  and
[38.06-38.68]  she
[38.68-38.94]  loved
[38.94-39.40]  kids,
[39.42-39.80]  kids
[39.80-39.94]  loved
[39.94-40.14]  her.
[40.72-40.88]  So
[40.88-41.06]  she
[41.06-41.50]  majored
[41.50-41.70]  in
[41.70-42.28]  elementary
[42.28-43.10]  education
[43.10-43.52]  at
[43.52-43.70]  my
[43.70-43.88]  not
[43.88-44.38]  state.
[44.98-45.26]  After
[45.26-45.42]  a
[45.42-45.80]  semester
[45.80-46.02]  in
[46.02-46.12]  the
[46.12-46.72]  dorms,
[46.88-47.04]  Anita
[47.04-47.48]  and
[47.48-47.66]  one
[47.66-47.78]  of
[47.78-47.88]  her
[47.88-48.32]  roommates,
[48.70-48.90]  Nicole
[48.90-49.40]  Thomas,
[49.90-50.20]  decided
[50.20-50.44]  to
[50.44-50.66]  move
[50.66-51.04]  off
[51.04-51.48]  campus.
[52.34-52.52]  I
[52.52-52.76]  think
[52.76-52.98]  they
[52.98-53.24]  just
[53.24-53.58]  wanted
[53.58-54.66]  to
[54.66-54.84]  have
[54.84-55.04]  their
[55.04-55.20]  own
[55.20-55.52]  space
[55.52-55.92]  so
[55.92-56.16]  then
[56.16-56.32]  they
[56.32-56.48]  were
[56.48-56.76]  both
[57.12-57.36]  Like,
[57.38-57.64]  let's
[57.64-57.72]  just
[57.72-57.88]  get
[57.88-57.98]  an
[57.98-58.22]  apartment
[58.22-58.66]  together
[58.66-58.94]  so
[58.94-59.14]  they
[59.14-59.38]  did.
[61.12-61.70]  Anita's
[61.70-62.10]  apartment
[62.10-62.58]  had
[62.58-62.90]  become
[62.90-63.12]  a
[63.12-63.42]  crime
[63.42-63.84]  scene.
[64.42-64.82]  Those
[64.82-65.04]  who
[65.04-65.30]  knew
[65.30-65.52]  and
[65.52-65.76]  loved
[65.76-66.02]  her
[66.02-66.38]  gathered
[66.38-67.10]  outside,
[67.64-67.94]  brimming
[67.94-68.22]  with
[68.22-68.62]  questions
[68.62-68.90]  for
[68.90-69.30]  police.
[70.16-70.76]  And
[70.76-71.06]  police
[71.06-71.38]  would
[71.38-71.54]  have
[71.54-71.98]  questions
[71.98-72.34]  for
[72.34-72.66]  some
[72.66-72.84]  of
[72.84-73.14]  them
[73.14-73.82]  about
[73.82-74.20]  Anita,
[74.66-74.90]  her
[74.90-75.26]  life,
[75.70-76.20]  and
[76.20-76.32]  the
[76.32-76.64]  people
[76.64-76.86]  who
[76.86-77.36]  surrounded
[77.36-77.66]  her.
[78.16-78.62]  She
[78.62-78.80]  got
[78.80-78.96]  any
[78.96-79.26]  guys
[79.26-79.48]  or
[79.48-79.80]  anything
[79.80-80.00]  that
[80.00-80.36]  she's
[80.36-80.78]  interested
[80.78-81.00]  in
[81.00-81.20]  over
[81.20-81.34]  there,
[81.54-81.84]  interested
[81.84-82.06]  in
[82.06-82.24]  her?
[83.10-83.70]  I
[83.70-83.80]  don't
[83.80-83.90]  know.
[84.00-84.12]  She
[84.12-84.26]  was
[84.26-84.48]  going
[84.48-84.78]  on
[84.78-84.78]  the
[84.78-84.94]  scale,

[202.59-202.87]  He
[202.87-203.19]  saw
[203.19-203.69]  Anita's
[203.69-204.07]  body
[204.07-204.83]  still
[204.83-205.09]  on
[205.09-205.21]  the
[205.21-205.53]  bed.
[206.01-206.23]  I
[206.23-206.35]  could
[206.35-206.57]  see
[206.57-206.79]  that
[206.79-207.11]  she
[207.11-208.11]  was
[208.11-208.61]  kind
[208.61-208.77]  of
[208.77-209.21]  flopped
[209.21-209.61]  over
[209.61-209.97]  laying
[209.97-210.15]  on
[210.15-210.31]  her
[210.31-210.69]  stomach.
[211.09-211.17]  I
[211.17-211.41]  noticed
[211.41-211.71]  her
[211.71-212.05]  room
[212.05-212.71]  seemed
[212.71-212.89]  to
[212.89-213.03]  be
[213.03-213.17]  in
[213.17-213.51]  order.
[213.85-213.99]  So
[213.99-214.09]  it
[214.09-214.31]  didn't
[214.31-214.49]  seem
[214.49-214.77]  like
[214.77-214.97]  there
[214.97-215.09]  had
[215.09-215.17]  been
[215.17-215.29]  a
[215.29-215.63]  struggle?
[215.97-216.19]  No.
[216.73-216.95]  There
[216.95-217.07]  did
[217.07-217.29]  not
[217.29-217.63]  seem
[217.63-217.77]  to
[217.77-217.91]  be
[217.91-217.97]  a
[217.97-218.27]  struggle
[218.27-218.49]  at
[218.49-218.69]  all.
[219.61-219.81]  I
[219.81-219.91]  had
[219.91-220.17]  also
[220.17-220.41]  looked
[220.41-220.71]  around
[220.71-221.03]  her
[221.03-221.75]  bedroom
[221.75-222.01]  and
[222.01-222.13]  I
[222.13-222.37]  noticed
[222.37-222.67]  that
[222.67-222.79]  her
[222.79-223.17]  purse
[223.17-223.35]  was
[223.35-223.67]  there.
[224.13-224.37]  I
[224.37-224.51]  could
[224.51-224.73]  see
[224.73-224.97]  that
[224.97-225.17]  there
[225.17-225.31]  was
[225.31-225.55]  cash
[225.55-225.87]  in
[225.87-225.99]  her
[225.99-226.47]  purse.
[226.79-226.99]  So
[226.99-227.11]  I
[227.11-227.33]  didn't
[227.33-227.53]  feel
[227.53-227.81]  like
[227.81-228.41]  it
[228.41-228.55]  had
[228.55-228.71]  been
[228.71-228.93]  any
[228.93-229.17]  sort
[229.17-229.87]  of

[231.07-231.19]  a

[232.16-232.44]  Gone
[232.44-232.78]  bad
[232.78-233.06]  type
[233.06-233.22]  of
[233.22-233.86]  situation.
[234.24-234.72]  They
[234.72-235.02]  moved
[235.02-235.44]  Anita's
[235.44-235.70]  body
[235.70-236.02]  to
[236.02-236.14]  the
[236.14-236.52]  floor.
[237.02-237.18]  We
[237.18-237.32]  could
[237.32-237.58]  see
[237.58-237.82]  that
[237.82-238.04]  she
[238.04-238.30]  had
[238.30-238.48]  a
[238.48-238.84]  stab
[238.84-239.32]  wound
[239.32-239.68]  to
[239.68-239.94]  her.

--- Chunk 4 ---

[0.08-0.64]  right
[0.64-1.38]  chest
[1.38-1.76]  area
[1.76-2.74]  and
[2.74-3.06]  also

[3.80-4.36]  to
[4.36-4.78]  her
[4.78-5.48]  sternum
[5.48-5.84]  area.
[6.88-6.94]  And
[6.94-7.08]  then
[7.08-7.24]  we
[7.24-7.52]  also
[7.52-7.78]  noticed
[7.78-8.08]  on
[8.08-8.20]  the
[8.20-8.60]  mattress
[8.60-9.18]  that
[9.18-9.40]  there
[9.40-9.62]  was
[9.62-9.86]  a

[11.82-12.08]  blood
[12.08-12.40]  where
[12.40-12.64]  blood
[12.64-12.84]  had
[12.84-13.12]  drained
[13.12-13.38]  from
[13.38-13.56]  her
[13.56-13.92]  body
[13.92-14.08]  and
[14.08-14.28]  soaked
[14.28-14.60]  into
[14.60-14.76]  the
[14.76-15.12]  mattress.
[16.20-16.68]  Anita
[16.68-17.16]  had
[17.16-17.38]  been
[17.38-17.76]  stabbed
[17.76-18.00]  in
[18.00-18.16]  the
[18.16-18.48]  heart
[18.48-19.26]  and
[19.26-19.40]  the

[21.82-22.24]  the
[22.24-22.44]  day
[22.44-22.88]  before.
[23.86-24.50]  Then,
[24.72-24.98]  right
[24.98-25.18]  by
[25.18-25.68]  Anita's
[25.68-25.96]  bed,
[26.50-27.02]  investigators
[27.02-27.40]  made
[27.40-27.58]  a
[27.58-27.80]  key
[27.80-28.50]  discovery.
[28.96-29.34]  A
[29.34-29.66]  knife
[29.66-30.28]  with
[30.28-30.42]  a
[30.42-30.94]  distinctive

[34.66-34.80]  the

[35.56-35.64]  and
[35.64-36.00]  testing
[36.00-36.22]  would
[36.22-36.68]  confirm
[36.68-37.14]  it
[37.14-37.38]  was
[37.38-37.48]  a
[37.48-37.70]  needle.
[39.30-39.94]  Investigators
[39.94-40.28]  gathered
[40.28-40.62]  more
[40.62-41.06]  evidence,

[42.58-42.86]  from
[42.86-43.34]  Anita's
[43.34-43.72]  window.
[44.32-44.46]  The
[44.46-44.80]  maintenance
[44.80-45.12]  man
[45.12-45.46]  said
[45.46-45.66]  he
[45.66-45.78]  had

[46.60-47.00]  repaired
[47.00-47.42]  earlier
[47.42-47.72]  that
[47.72-48.16]  day.
[48.68-48.94]  It
[48.94-49.08]  had
[49.08-49.26]  been
[49.26-50.02]  slashed.
[50.44-50.74]  It
[50.74-51.04]  appeared
[51.04-51.30]  that
[51.30-51.82]  somebody
[51.82-52.12]  had
[52.12-52.80]  used
[52.80-52.96]  a

[58.42-58.94]  Is
[58.94-59.12]  that
[59.12-59.38]  how
[59.38-59.54]  the
[59.54-59.76]  killer
[59.76-60.04]  got
[60.04-60.30]  in?
[60.82-60.94]  Or
[60.94-61.10]  did
[61.10-61.58]  someone
[61.58-61.92]  come

[62.14-62.28]  the
[62.28-62.70]  apartment
[62.70-63.08]  door?
[63.84-64.22]  That
[64.22-64.50]  door
[64.50-64.84]  was
[64.84-65.16]  locked
[65.16-65.40]  when
[65.40-65.80]  Anita's
[65.80-66.04]  father
[66.04-66.34]  tried
[66.34-66.54]  to
[66.54-66.82]  enter,
[67.20-67.42]  so
[67.42-67.60]  if
[67.60-67.94]  someone
[67.94-68.20]  came
[68.20-68.40]  in
[68.40-68.58]  that
[68.58-68.84]  way,
[69.18-69.38]  they
[69.38-69.52]  would
[69.52-69.74]  need
[69.74-69.86]  a
[69.86-70.12]  key.
[70.86-71.00]  This

[76.54-76.66]  You

[139.22-139.52]  Wow,
[139.70-139.78]  it
[139.78-139.98]  was
[139.98-140.80]  huge

[142.16-142.42]  Kim
[142.42-143.04]  Fundingsland
[143.04-143.32]  was
[143.32-143.64]  born

[152.26-152.48]  was
[152.48-153.40]  monstrous
[153.40-153.74]  news.
[154.06-154.12]  The
[154.12-154.24]  whole
[154.24-154.80]  community
[154.80-155.06]  was

[155.88-156.02]  the
[156.02-156.36]  story

[156.62-157.76]  riveted
[157.76-158.24]  to
[158.24-158.46]  it.
[158.78-158.96]  While

[160.70-161.06]  Anita's
[161.06-161.40]  family
[161.40-161.60]  and
[161.60-161.96]  friends
[161.96-162.48]  were
[162.48-162.96]  frozen
[162.96-163.12]  in
[163.12-163.50]  place.
[164.22-164.38]  Was
[164.38-164.52]  this
[164.52-164.66]  a
[164.66-164.90]  scary
[164.90-165.16]  time
[165.16-165.34]  for
[165.34-165.48]  you?
[166.02-166.38]  Definitely.

[169.38-169.56]  is
[169.56-169.66]  a
[169.66-169.90]  safe
[169.90-170.48]  community
[170.48-171.14]  and
[171.14-171.60]  who
[171.60-171.80]  really
[171.80-172.00]  cares
[172.00-172.24]  if
[172.24-172.36]  your
[172.36-172.58]  doors
[172.58-172.76]  are
[172.76-173.02]  locked
[173.02-173.22]  or
[173.22-173.38]  not.
[174.57-174.77]  From
[174.77-174.97]  that
[174.97-175.21]  day
[175.21-175.45]  on,
[175.47-175.67]  the
[175.67-175.85]  doors
[175.85-176.11]  were
[176.11-176.61]  definitely
[176.61-176.99]  locked
[176.99-177.39]  when
[177.39-177.61]  it
[177.61-177.71]  got
[177.71-177.89]  to
[177.89-177.99]  be
[177.99-178.25]  dark.
[178.69-178.81]  The
[178.81-179.05]  shades
[179.05-179.29]  were
[179.29-179.53]  pulled.
[179.97-180.07]  I
[180.07-180.29]  felt
[180.29-180.55]  like,
[180.77-181.19]  for

[181.31-181.49]  long
[181.49-181.95]  time,
[182.13-182.21]  and
[182.21-182.29]  I
[182.29-182.49]  still
[182.49-182.71]  am.
[182.85-183.11]  I'm
[183.11-183.31]  very
[183.31-183.75]  hyper
[183.75-184.09]  aware

[185.53-185.77]  at,
[186.05-186.13]  who's
[186.13-186.49]  around.
[186.97-187.19]  People
[187.19-187.41]  were
[187.41-187.79]  worried.
[188.57-189.09]  It's
[189.09-189.15]  just
[189.15-189.57]  that's
[189.57-189.57]  the
[189.57-189.69]  way
[189.69-189.81]  it
[189.81-190.05]  was.
[191.87-192.23]  Meanwhile,
[192.63-193.27]  investigators
[193.27-193.71]  began
[193.71-194.15]  piecing
[194.15-194.53]  together
[194.53-194.79]  a
[194.79-195.11]  picture
[195.11-195.47]  of

[196.57-197.01]  Anita's
[197.01-197.29]  final
[197.29-197.75]  moments.
[198.35-198.83]  Looking

[199.03-199.15]  her
[199.15-199.53]  phone,
[199.85-200.09]  you

[158.54-158.84]  said
[158.84-159.08]  he
[159.08-159.20]  had
[159.20-159.34]  been
[159.34-159.72]  texting
[159.72-160.04]  Anita
[160.04-160.44]  from
[160.44-160.58]  a
[160.58-161.00]  friend's
[161.00-161.22]  house
[161.22-161.68]  and
[161.68-161.82]  he
[161.82-162.06]  stayed
[162.06-162.40]  there
[162.40-162.56]  the
[162.56-162.74]  rest
[162.74-162.94]  of
[162.94-163.04]  the
[163.04-163.46]  night.
[163.82-164.22]  Police
[164.22-164.50]  told
[164.50-164.90]  Michael
[164.90-165.24]  he
[165.24-165.44]  was
[165.44-165.76]  free
[165.76-165.90]  to
[165.90-166.14]  go
[166.14-166.76]  for
[166.76-167.14]  now.
[168.08-168.52]  Two
[168.52-168.80]  days
[168.80-169.18]  after
[169.18-169.68]  Anita's
[169.68-169.94]  murder,
[170.40-170.46]  the
[170.46-170.78]  medical
[170.78-171.46]  examiner
[171.46-171.92]  released
[171.92-172.24]  the
[172.24-172.78]  autopsy
[172.78-173.16]  report.
[173.78-174.16]  Was
[174.16-174.26]  there
[174.26-174.40]  any
[174.40-174.74]  sexual
[174.74-175.04]  assault?
[175.52-175.66]  There
[175.66-175.82]  was
[175.82-176.16]  nothing
[176.16-176.44]  that
[176.44-176.62]  we
[176.62-176.84]  could
[176.84-177.20]  see
[177.20-177.52]  that
[177.52-177.72]  would
[177.72-178.14]  indicate
[178.14-178.64]  that
[178.64-178.86]  she
[178.86-179.00]  was
[179.00-179.44]  sexually
[179.44-179.82]  assaulted.
[180.22-180.30]  It
[180.30-180.44]  was
[180.44-180.96]  definitely
[180.96-181.76]  something
[181.76-182.04]  that
[182.04-182.28]  we
[182.28-182.56]  were
[182.56-183.30]  concerned
[183.30-183.78]  about
[183.78-184.02]  and
[184.02-184.12]  it
[184.12-184.24]  was
[184.24-184.40]  on
[184.40-184.54]  our
[184.54-184.96]  minds.
[185.34-185.64]  But
[185.64-185.84]  the
[185.84-186.50]  autopsy
[186.50-186.90]  did
[186.90-187.34]  reveal
[187.34-187.98]  something
[187.98-188.50]  that
[188.50-188.88]  peaked
[188.88-189.10]  their
[189.10-189.74]  interest.
[190.04-190.32]  We
[190.32-190.94]  found
[190.94-191.10]  out
[191.10-191.26]  that
[191.26-191.46]  there
[191.46-191.62]  was
[191.62-192.36]  superficial
[192.36-193.26]  cuts
[193.26-193.78]  or
[193.78-194.08]  marks
[194.08-194.74]  on
[194.74-195.34]  Anita's
[195.34-195.50]  neck,
[196.10-196.52]  so
[196.52-197.54]  it
[197.54-197.74]  led
[197.74-197.94]  us
[197.94-198.06]  to
[198.06-198.34]  believe
[198.34-198.58]  that
[198.58-199.00]  somebody
[199.00-199.26]  is
[199.26-199.54]  there
[199.54-199.86]  kind
[199.86-200.00]  of
[200.00-200.16]  in
[200.16-200.34]  her
[200.34-200.68]  face
[200.68-201.58]  holding
[201.58-201.82]  the
[201.82-202.00]  knife
[202.00-202.30]  to
[202.30-202.44]  her
[202.44-202.68]  neck
[202.68-203.52]  and
[203.52-203.72]  then
[203.72-205.16]  an
[205.16-205.58]  angry
[205.58-206.12]  and
[206.12-206.34]  then
[206.34-206.52]  that
[206.52-206.76]  just
[206.76-207.44]  escalated
[207.44-207.62]  to
[207.62-207.70]  the
[207.70-207.96]  point
[207.96-208.44]  of
[208.44-209.40]  stabbing
[209.40-209.68]  her.
[210.40-211.00]  When
[211.00-211.10]  you
[211.10-211.24]  think
[211.24-211.42]  about
[211.42-211.60]  those
[211.60-212.06]  details,
[212.06-212.54]  does
[212.54-212.64]  that
[212.64-213.00]  sound
[213.00-213.54]  like
[214.19-214.77]  Possibly
[214.77-215.05]  someone
[215.05-215.29]  she
[215.29-215.67]  knew,
[216.09-216.23]  a
[216.23-216.39]  complete
[216.39-217.03]  stranger.
[217.53-217.97]  We
[217.97-218.19]  felt
[218.19-218.41]  like
[218.41-218.57]  it
[218.57-218.67]  was
[218.67-219.01]  somebody
[219.01-219.21]  that
[219.21-219.45]  she
[219.45-219.77]  knew.
[220.67-220.77]  And
[220.77-220.95]  as
[220.95-221.13]  my
[221.13-221.31]  not
[221.31-221.71]  police
[221.71-222.53]  continued
[222.53-223.03]  talking
[223.03-223.27]  to
[223.27-223.47]  those
[223.47-223.83]  close
[223.83-224.11]  to
[224.11-224.35]  Anita,
[225.03-225.17]  they
[225.17-225.41]  got
[225.41-225.71]  a
[225.71-226.35]  promising
[226.35-226.85]  tip.
[227.33-227.53]  We
[227.53-227.69]  did
[227.69-227.93]  have
[227.93-228.19]  one
[228.19-228.71]  witness
[228.71-229.37]  come
[229.37-229.81]  forward
[229.81-230.05]  and
[230.05-230.29]  say
[230.29-230.53]  that
[230.53-230.89]  she
[230.89-231.43]  saw
[231.43-231.87]  somebody
[231.87-232.35]  running
[232.35-232.95]  early
[232.95-233.19]  that
[233.19-233.63]  morning.
[234.13-234.43]  It
[234.43-234.59]  was
[234.59-234.73]  a
[234.73-235.07]  man
[235.07-235.93]  running
[235.93-236.47]  near
[236.47-237.01]  Anita's
[237.01-237.51]  apartment.
[238.15-238.37]  He
[238.37-238.75]  appeared
[238.75-238.95]  to
[238.95-239.09]  be
[239.09-239.27]  in
[239.27-239.45]  his
[239.45-239.73]  late

--- Chunk 7 ---
[0.00-0.36]  teens
[0.36-0.48]  or
[0.48-0.82]  early
[0.82-1.44]  20s,
[1.56-1.92]  about
[1.92-2.18]  6
[2.18-2.48]  to
[2.48-3.24]  200
[3.24-3.54]  pounds
[3.54-4.14]  with
[4.14-4.48]  dark
[4.48-4.94]  hair.
[5.50-5.70]  And
[5.70-5.84]  there
[5.84-5.98]  was
[5.98-6.38]  something
[6.38-6.80]  more.
[7.32-7.42]  The
[7.42-7.68]  witness
[7.68-7.98]  said
[7.98-8.22]  there
[8.22-8.44]  was
[8.44-8.62]  a
[8.62-9.00]  stain
[9.00-9.26]  on
[9.26-9.42]  his
[9.42-9.82]  shirt,
[10.36-10.90]  possibly
[10.90-11.28]  blood.
[12.20-12.76]  It
[12.76-12.90]  was
[12.90-13.08]  their
[13.08-13.50]  first
[13.50-13.78]  big
[13.78-14.26]  lead.
[14.70-15.02]  Now
[15.02-15.30]  they
[15.30-15.58]  needed
[15.58-15.82]  to
[15.82-16.28]  find
[16.28-16.52]  the
[16.52-16.80]  running
[16.80-17.16]  man.
[17.64-17.84]  Maybe
[17.84-18.00]  it's
[18.00-18.16]  running
[18.16-18.44]  away
[18.44-18.64]  from
[18.64-18.76]  a
[18.76-18.90]  crime
[18.90-19.16]  scene.
[34.35-34.81]  About
[34.81-35.13]  two
[35.13-35.39]  days
[35.39-35.83]  after
[35.83-36.19]  Anita
[36.19-36.85]  Knutson's
[36.85-37.09]  murder,
[37.63-37.91]  police
[37.91-38.29]  were
[38.29-38.71]  chasing
[38.71-39.09]  a
[39.09-39.37]  new
[39.37-39.79]  tip.
[40.55-40.73]  A
[40.73-40.95]  woman
[40.95-41.23]  said
[41.23-41.43]  she
[41.43-41.63]  saw
[41.63-41.83]  a
[41.83-42.17]  young,
[42.39-42.61]  dark
[42.61-42.91] -haired
[42.91-43.23]  man
[43.23-43.85]  running
[43.85-44.19]  right
[44.19-44.45]  near
[44.45-44.91]  Anita's
[44.91-45.35]  apartment
[45.35-46.07]  around
[46.07-46.31]  the
[46.31-46.53]  time
[46.53-46.69]  of
[46.69-46.79]  the
[46.79-47.13]  murder.
[47.95-48.51]  And
[48.51-48.67]  he
[48.67-49.05]  looked
[49.05-49.45]  like
[49.45-49.63]  he
[49.63-49.79]  was
[49.79-49.93]  in
[49.93-50.05]  a
[50.05-50.41]  big
[50.41-50.83]  hurry.
[52.11-52.31]  So
[52.31-52.47]  she's
[52.47-52.65]  thinking
[52.65-53.01]  maybe
[53.01-53.23]  it's
[53.23-53.43]  not
[53.43-54.59]  running
[54.59-54.79]  out
[54.79-54.91]  for
[54.91-55.29]  exercise.
[55.55-55.71]  Maybe
[55.71-55.87]  it's
[55.87-56.01]  running
[56.01-56.29]  away
[56.29-56.51]  from
[56.51-56.67]  a
[56.67-56.77]  crime
[56.77-57.03]  scene.
[57.13-57.69]  That's
[57.69-57.81]  what
[57.81-58.03]  she
[58.03-58.29]  thought
[58.29-58.47]  it
[58.47-58.67]  could
[58.67-59.01]  be.
[59.83-60.15]  Why
[60.15-60.29]  not
[60.29-60.71]  police
[60.71-61.17]  released
[61.17-61.59]  the
[61.59-61.93]  running
[61.93-62.25]  man
[62.25-62.65]  description
[62.65-63.01]  to
[63.01-63.11]  the
[63.11-63.51]  media
[63.84-64.18]  and
[64.18-64.34]  it
[64.34-64.56]  did
[64.56-65.04]  generate
[65.04-65.30]  some
[65.30-65.60]  tips,
[66.14-66.48]  but
[66.48-66.78]  none
[66.78-66.94]  of
[66.94-67.18]  them
[67.18-67.48]  went
[67.48-68.16]  anywhere.
[70.38-71.00]  Back
[71.00-71.20]  in
[71.20-71.70]  Anita's
[71.70-72.08]  hometown
[72.08-72.36]  of
[72.36-72.98]  Bute,
[72.98-73.14]  her
[73.14-73.58]  presence
[73.58-74.26]  was
[74.26-75.18]  everywhere.
[76.20-76.88]  And
[76.88-77.02]  on
[77.02-77.28]  one
[77.28-77.76]  particular
[77.76-78.28]  day,
[78.66-78.76]  her
[78.76-79.18]  friends
[79.18-79.58]  honored
[79.58-79.86]  her
[79.86-80.18]  with
[80.18-80.34]  a
[80.34-80.88]  brilliant
[80.88-81.22]  burst
[81.22-81.48]  of
[81.48-81.82]  light
[81.82-82.60]  in
[82.60-83.04]  true
[83.04-83.68]  Anita's
[83.68-84.08]  style.
[84.80-85.08]  There
[85.08-85.20]  was
[85.20-85.36]  an
[85.36-85.78]  outpouring
[85.78-85.94]  of
[85.94-86.16]  love
[86.16-86.96]  in
[86.96-87.34]  Bute.
[87.48-87.68]  Yeah.
[87.98-88.16]  After
[88.16-88.36]  Anita
[88.36-88.66]  died.
[89.02-89.20]  Yeah.
[89.74-90.18]  Leading
[90.18-90.34]  up
[90.34-90.50]  to
[90.50-90.60]  the
[90.60-90.92]  funeral,
[91.40-91.50]  a
[91.50-91.64]  lot
[91.64-91.76]  of
[91.76-91.92]  us
[91.92-92.14]  girls
[92.14-92.36]  had
[92.36-92.56]  gotten
[92.56-92.98]  together
[92.98-93.28]  and
[93.28-93.44]  we
[93.44-94.52]  made
[94.52-95.30]  bracelets
[95.30-96.42]  and
[96.42-97.02]  pins
[97.02-98.28]  and
[98.28-99.88]  decorated
[99.88-100.24]  main
[100.24-100.62]  streets
[100.62-101.24]  with
[101.24-101.54]  pink
[101.54-102.18]  ribbons.
[102.50-102.58]  I
[102.58-102.68]  mean,
[102.76-103.16]  it's
[103.16-103.32]  such
[103.32-103.40]  a
[103.40-103.60]  close
[103.60-103.76]  knit
[103.76-104.26]  community.
[104.48-104.58]  It's
[104.58-104.76]  really
[104.76-105.40]  amazing.
[106.90-107.34]  All
[107.34-107.62]  over
[107.62-107.92]  town,
[107.94-108.30]  there's
[108.30-108.40]  all
[108.40-108.56]  these
[108.56-108.74]  little
[108.74-108.94]  pink
[108.94-109.52]  ribbons
[109.52-109.82]  tied
[109.82-110.08]  up.
[110.60-110.76]  You
[110.76-110.86]  could
[110.86-111.04]  drive
[111.04-111.30]  by
[111.30-111.50]  and
[111.50-111.60]  it
[111.60-111.78]  wouldn't

[134.71-134.91]  miss
[134.91-135.07]  you

[139.49-139.59]  just
[139.59-139.79]  pink
[139.79-140.31]  everywhere.
[140.69-140.77]  Were
[140.77-140.89]  you
[140.89-141.35]  surprised
[141.35-141.61]  to

[143.43-143.93]  just
[143.93-144.23]  painted
[144.23-144.47]  pink
[144.47-144.77]  for
[144.77-144.95]  her?
[145.15-145.35]  Yeah.
[145.76-146.00]  I
[146.00-146.10]  was
[146.10-146.28]  from
[146.28-146.56]  Southern
[146.56-146.98]  California
[146.98-147.26]  so

[147.84-148.16]  doesn't
[148.16-148.32]  know
[148.32-148.80]  everybody.
[149.28-149.88]  So
[149.88-150.16]  coming
[150.16-150.36]  out
[150.36-150.58]  here
[150.58-150.80]  and
[150.80-150.94]  just,
[151.58-151.84]  it's
[151.84-152.20]  definitely
[152.20-152.56]  a
[152.56-153.26]  smaller
[153.26-153.88]  town
[153.88-154.26]  and

[156.02-156.42]  out
[156.42-156.70]  here
[156.70-157.32]  just
[157.32-157.54]  because
[157.54-158.14]  everybody
[158.14-158.78]  knows
[158.78-159.06]  each
[159.06-159.40]  other.
[159.82-160.08]  And
[160.08-160.24]  on
[160.24-160.36]  the
[160.36-160.54]  day
[160.54-160.70]  of
[160.70-160.78]  the
[160.78-161.16]  funeral,
[161.70-161.76]  the
[161.76-162.28]  entire

[163.60-163.90]  to
[163.90-164.10]  say
[164.10-164.54]  goodbye.
[165.02-165.20]  What
[165.20-165.42]  stands
[165.42-165.66]  out

[166.44-167.06]  about
[167.06-167.28]  her
[167.28-167.58]  funeral?
[167.95-168.13]  I
[168.13-168.25]  think
[168.25-168.39]  just
[168.39-168.53]  how
[168.53-168.71]  many
[168.71-169.09]  people

[169.29-169.53]  there

[169.85-170.31]  celebrate
[170.31-170.75]  my
[170.75-171.07]  sister.
[171.67-171.67]  I
[171.67-171.79]  mean,
[172.33-172.43]  she
[172.43-173.07]  truly
[173.07-173.25]  was
[173.25-173.59]  so
[173.59-174.01]  well
[174.01-174.55]  loved.
[174.73-174.73]  I
[174.73-174.91]  mean,
[175.11-175.19]  the
[175.19-175.37]  whole
[175.37-175.67]  church
[175.67-175.93]  was
[175.93-176.19]  full.
[176.37-176.45]  They
[176.45-176.57]  ended
[176.57-176.73]  up
[176.73-176.87]  having
[176.87-177.15]  to
[177.15-177.69]  open
[177.69-177.83]  up
[177.83-177.99]  the
[177.99-178.21]  gym
[178.21-178.41]  at
[178.41-178.51]  the
[178.51-178.87]  school
[178.87-179.21]  for
[179.21-179.33]  all
[179.33-179.45]  of

[179.55-179.97]  overflow
[179.97-180.45]  people.
[181.03-181.23]  And
[181.23-181.35]  they
[181.35-181.65]  watched
[181.65-181.97]  it,
[181.97-182.13]  like,
[182.19-182.37]  on
[182.37-182.71]  a
[182.71-183.05]  stream.
[183.63-183.71]  Did
[183.71-183.81]  you
[183.81-184.01]  speak
[184.01-184.21]  that
[184.21-184.35]  day?
[184.73-184.85]  I
[184.85-185.05]  did,
[185.23-185.43]  yeah.
[185.65-185.81]  I
[185.81-186.41]  got
[186.41-186.53]  up
[186.53-186.71]  there
[186.71-186.91]  and
[186.91-187.07]  just
[187.07-187.31]  said
[187.31-187.53]  a
[187.53-187.67]  few
[187.67-188.07]  words
[188.07-188.35]  about
[188.35-188.51]  my
[188.51-188.89]  sister
[188.89-189.17]  and
[189.17-189.33]  just
[189.33-189.59]  talked
[189.59-189.87]  about
[189.87-190.15]  how
[190.15-190.79]  just
[190.79-191.83]  effervescent

[193.53-193.91]  perfect,
[194.15-194.31]  really.
[194.73-195.01]  I
[195.01-195.13]  think
[195.13-195.27]  I
[195.27-195.43]  wore
[195.43-195.63]  one
[195.63-195.71]  of

[204.15-204.31]  of
[204.31-204.45]  the
[204.45-204.73]  grief,
[205.31-205.43]  there
[205.43-205.69]  were
[205.69-206.81]  suspicions,
[207.29-207.63]  rumors
[207.63-208.35]  about
[208.35-208.87]  who

[22.46-23.12]  between

[36.86-37.10]  can't
[37.10-37.38]  believe
[37.38-37.72]  that

[38.24-38.42]  room
[38.42-38.48]  we're
[38.48-38.66]  going
[38.66-38.96]  around
[38.96-39.18]  and
[39.18-39.68]  paraphrasing,
[39.68-39.92]  of
[39.92-40.06]  course,
[40.20-40.28]  because
[40.28-40.40]  I
[40.40-40.60]  can't
[40.60-40.80]  remember
[40.80-41.00]  the
[41.00-41.22]  exact
[41.22-41.50]  words,
[41.70-41.78]  but
[41.78-42.60]  something
[42.60-42.84]  to
[42.84-43.02]  the
[43.02-43.34]  effect
[43.34-43.84]  of,
[43.98-44.00]  I
[44.00-44.86]  can't
[44.86-45.06]  believe
[45.06-45.30]  that
[45.30-45.54]  people
[45.54-45.68]  are
[45.68-45.94]  blaming
[45.94-46.26]  my
[46.26-46.56]  daughter
[46.56-46.82]  for
[46.82-47.02]  this.
[47.44-47.56]  This
[47.56-47.66]  is
[47.66-47.84]  all
[47.84-48.24]  happening
[48.24-48.64]  at
[48.64-48.76]  the
[48.76-49.02]  funeral.
[49.66-49.96]  Yes,
[50.10-50.30]  before
[50.30-50.48]  the
[50.48-50.76]  actual
[50.76-51.12]  funeral
[51.12-51.48]  started,
[51.68-51.76]  yeah.
[52.44-52.80]  I
[52.80-53.26]  turned
[53.26-53.74]  around
[53.74-54.24]  and
[54.24-55.16]  it
[55.16-55.32]  was
[55.32-55.50]  just
[55.50-55.96]  wild.
[56.36-56.58]  It
[56.58-56.80]  was
[56.80-57.18]  just
[57.18-58.22]  wild
[58.22-58.56]  behavior
[58.56-58.84]  for
[58.84-58.94]  an
[58.94-59.14]  adult.
[60.14-60.36]  But
[60.36-60.52]  the
[60.52-60.74]  dust
[60.74-61.24]  settled,
[61.72-61.78]  and
[61.78-61.88]  the
[61.88-62.22]  memorial
[62.22-62.78]  moved
[62.78-63.18]  on.
[64.16-64.64]  And
[64.64-64.72]  a
[64.72-65.02]  very
[65.02-65.34]  close
[65.34-65.78]  friend
[65.78-66.14]  took
[66.14-66.56]  over,
[67.02-67.28]  Tyler
[67.28-68.08]  Schmaltz,
[68.50-68.58]  the
[68.58-68.76]  young
[68.76-69.04]  man
[69.04-69.26]  on
[69.26-69.40]  the
[69.40-69.66]  scene
[69.66-69.92]  that
[69.92-70.22]  first
[70.22-70.62]  night.
[71.46-71.72]  He
[71.72-71.86]  was
[71.86-72.14]  now
[72.14-72.52]  in
[72.52-72.64]  the
[72.64-73.02]  middle
[73.02-73.28]  of
[73.28-73.78]  Anita's
[73.78-74.18]  goodbye.
[75.06-75.54]  We
[75.54-75.66]  made
[75.66-75.76]  a
[75.76-76.06]  slideshow
[76.06-76.20]  for
[76.20-76.28]  her
[76.28-76.52]  parents.
[77.02-77.14]  What
[77.14-77.26]  kind
[77.26-77.36]  of
[77.36-77.58]  pictures
[77.58-77.80]  did
[77.80-77.92]  you
[77.92-78.06]  want
[78.06-78.16]  to
[78.16-78.36]  pick
[78.36-78.56]  of
[78.56-78.78]  Anita?
[79.06-79.12]  The
[79.12-79.30]  prom
[79.30-79.54]  ones
[79.54-79.74]  where
[79.74-79.94]  she's
[79.94-80.10]  dancing,
[80.40-80.60]  where
[80.60-80.84]  she's
[80.84-80.92]  with
[80.92-81.18]  friends
[81.18-81.36]  and
[81.36-81.70]  family.
[82.16-82.64]  Just
[82.64-82.80]  her
[82.80-83.00]  living
[83.00-83.20]  her
[83.20-83.44]  life.
[84.75-85.23]  He
[85.23-85.57]  also
[85.57-85.83]  took
[85.83-85.93]  it
[85.93-86.17]  upon
[86.17-86.61]  himself
[86.61-86.95]  to
[86.95-87.29]  arrange
[87.29-87.63]  a
[87.63-87.97]  send
[87.97-88.21] -off
[88.21-88.55]  with
[88.55-88.87]  pink
[88.87-89.29]  balloons.
[96.19-96.87]  Through
[96.87-97.05]  it
[97.05-97.35]  all,
[97.61-97.81]  police
[97.81-98.29]  wondered
[98.29-98.55]  if
[98.55-98.75]  the
[98.75-99.01]  killer
[99.01-99.55]  was
[99.55-99.97]  among
[99.97-100.21]  the
[100.21-100.89]  mourners,
[101.27-101.49]  and
[101.49-101.63]  they
[101.63-101.81]  had
[101.81-102.05]  some
[102.05-102.35]  very
[102.35-103.11]  particular
[103.11-103.65]  questions
[103.65-103.95]  for
[103.95-104.13]  that
[104.13-104.43]  close
[104.43-104.99]  friend,
[105.37-105.61]  Tyler
[105.61-106.35]  Schmolts.
[107.03-107.25]  Three
[107.25-107.49]  days
[107.49-107.85]  after
[107.85-108.03]  the
[108.03-108.37]  funeral,
[108.85-109.09]  Tyler
[109.09-109.45]  found
[109.45-109.93]  himself
[109.93-110.39]  once
[110.39-110.99]  again
[110.99-111.67]  talking
[111.67-111.95]  with
[111.95-112.37]  police.
[119.60-120.06]  Did
[120.06-120.16]  you
[120.16-120.32]  have
[120.32-120.78]  anybody
[120.78-121.12]  that
[121.12-121.26]  you
[121.26-121.48]  thought
[121.48-122.02]  that
[122.02-122.16]  you
[122.16-122.50]  suspected
[122.50-122.82]  at
[122.82-122.90]  the
[122.90-123.12]  time
[123.12-123.78]  back
[123.78-124.06]  then
[124.06-124.50]  Tyler?
[128.84-129.48]  Now
[129.48-129.74]  they
[129.74-129.90]  had
[129.90-130.10]  the
[130.10-130.66]  final
[130.66-131.22]  answer
[131.22-131.98]  or
[131.98-132.20]  did
[132.20-132.54]  they?
[133.16-133.58]  Nothing
[133.58-133.90]  is
[133.90-134.20]  more
[134.20-134.66]  suspense
[134.66-135.04]  than
[135.04-135.18]  a
[135.18-135.50]  date
[135.50-135.76]  line
[135.76-136.32]  mystery
[136.32-136.92]  and
[136.92-137.14]  no
[137.14-137.30]  one
[137.30-137.60]  wants
[137.60-137.74]  to
[137.74-137.92]  wait
[137.92-138.10]  to
[138.10-138.32]  find
[138.32-138.52]  out
[138.52-138.74]  what
[138.74-139.04]  happens
[139.04-139.50]  next
[139.50-140.26]  That's
[140.26-140.42]  why
[140.42-140.94]  everyone
[140.94-141.38]  needs
[141.38-141.62]  date
[141.62-141.94]  line
[141.94-142.48]  premium
[142.48-143.06]  where

[144.32-144.82]  ad
[144.82-145.06] -free
[145.06-145.72]  you

[146.28-146.82]  story
[146.82-147.18]  and
[147.18-147.64]  nothing
[147.64-147.88]  but
[147.88-148.08]  the
[148.08-148.50]  story
[148.83-149.23]  Or
[149.23-149.81]  do
[149.81-150.19]  you?
[150.63-151.17]  Yes,
[151.69-152.09]  actually.
[152.65-152.75]  You
[152.75-152.99]  do.
[168.09-168.47]  Mayor,
[168.67-168.77]  will
[168.77-168.99]  I
[168.99-169.15]  be

[172.35-172.43]  The
[172.43-172.57]  lag
[172.57-172.81]  won't
[172.81-172.91]  be
[172.91-173.03]  an
[173.03-173.27]  issue,
[173.41-173.45]  but
[173.45-173.63]  your
[173.63-174.03]  questionable
[174.03-174.51]  skills,
[174.73-174.99]  maybe.
[175.47-175.67]  And
[175.67-175.79]  what
[175.79-175.91]  if
[175.91-176.01]  I
[176.01-176.15]  have
